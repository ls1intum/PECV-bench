      "description": "The problem statement contains a contradictory requirement about the constructor parameters for LaunchedRollerCoaster. The general instruction (line 5 of the problem statement) requires that each class constructor takes all attributes defined in the UML in the same order, and the UML/RollerCoaster class requires numberOfLoopings (int). However, Task 6 (lines 63-64) explicitly requires that the constructor of LaunchedRollerCoaster must only accept name and abbreviation. The solution implementation contradicts Task 6: LaunchedRollerCoaster in the solution accepts (String name, char abbreviation, int numberOfLoopings). This inconsistency will confuse students: if they follow Task 6 literally they will produce a constructor that does not provide numberOfLoopings to the superclass RollerCoaster (which requires it), potentially causing compilation errors or forcing undocumented workarounds.",

      "suggested_fix": "Resolve the contradiction by making the constructor requirement consistent across the UML, tasks, template, and solution. Two straightforward fixes: (a) Update Task 6 in the problem statement to require LaunchedRollerCoaster(String name, char abbreviation, int numberOfLoopings) so it matches the UML RollerCoaster attribute and the provided solution; or (b) change the UML/RollerCoaster design (and its constructor) to allow LaunchedRollerCoaster to supply only name and abbreviation (for example by giving RollerCoaster a constructor overload or a sensible default for numberOfLoopings) and update the solution accordingly. Option (a) is recommended because it preserves the UML attribute and avoids introducing implicit defaults."
