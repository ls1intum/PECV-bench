      "description": "The problem statement UML defines the Pneumatic interface with two abstract methods: raisePressure(int pressureIncrease) and openValve(). In the solution repository, Pneumatic.java declares raisePressure(int) and releasePressure() (method name differs), while the implementing classes (LaunchedDropdownTower and LaunchedRollerCoaster) implement openValve() rather than releasePressure(). This creates a signature/name mismatch between the interface and its implementations and a contradiction with the UML/specification. As a result the solution as provided is internally inconsistent and would not compile; students comparing the UML/spec to the solution will be confused about the required method name/signature for the second pneumatic operation.",

Replace releasePressure() in solution_repository/src/de/tum/in/ase/Pneumatic.java with openValve() (void openValve()), keeping raisePressure(int). Ensure LaunchedDropdownTower and LaunchedRollerCoaster implement raisePressure(int) and openValve() (or, alternatively, change the UML/problem statement to require releasePressure() instead of openValve()). The recommended fix is to update the solution Pneumatic interface to declare openValve() so it matches the UML and the implementing classes."

In the solution repository, the Pneumatic interface instead declares releasePressure(), while the concrete classes (LaunchedRollerCoaster, LaunchedDropdownTower) implement an openValve() method. This naming mismatch between the problem specification, the interface, and the implementing classes prevents a clear mapping for students and is likely unintended (it also leads to an interface/implementation inconsistency).",
