      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares Ride's attributes as protected (#name: String and #abbreviation: char) while the provided solution (and likely the intended template) implement these attributes as private. This is a visibility mismatch between the specification (UML) and the implementation. Students reading the UML might expect protected fields (e.g., to be accessible in subclasses) and could be confused whether to declare the attributes protected or private.",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the visibility consistent. Either update the UML in the problem statement to use private ('-') for Ride's attributes to match the implementation, or change the template/solution to declare the fields as protected. Preferably update the UML to '-' (private) to avoid encouraging direct field access from subclasses and to match the provided implementation and tests; ensure the problem text clarifies that getters remain public."
