      "description": "The problem statement explicitly requires that ExcellenceLand has a private attribute 'rides' of type List<Ride> and that public getters are provided. In the solution repository, the 'rides' attribute is declared public (public List<Ride> rides;). This visibility mismatch contradicts the specification and may confuse students about the intended encapsulation (they are instructed to declare the field private). It also risks failing tests or encouraging incorrect implementations if students follow the solution instead of the specification.",

Ensure the constructor still assigns this.rides = rides. This aligns the solution with the problem statement's requirement for encapsulation."
