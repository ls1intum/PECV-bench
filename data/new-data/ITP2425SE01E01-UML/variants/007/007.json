      "description": "The solution implementation of Ride is missing the required public constructor Ride(String name, char abbreviation) even though the problem statement requires a public constructor for each class (attributes in same order) and several classes in the solution (RollerCoaster, LaunchedDropdownTower, LaunchedRollerCoaster) call super(name, abbreviation). This makes the solution internally inconsistent and would be uncompilable/confusing: students see subclasses calling super(...) but the solution's Ride does not declare the corresponding constructor or assign the attributes. The template Ride.java is also empty (intentional for the exercise), but the solution should still demonstrate the required constructor. ",

      "suggested_fix": "Add the required public constructor to Ride with the signature public Ride(String name, char abbreviation) and assign the fields accordingly. This should match the constructor calls in subclasses (e.g. super(name, abbreviation)) and the problem statement's requirement. For example, in solution_repository/src/de/tum/in/ase/Ride.java add:\n\npublic Ride(String name, char abbreviation) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.abbreviation = abbreviation;\n}\n\nEnsure the template or reference solution includes this constructor so students and the provided solution are structurally consistent."
