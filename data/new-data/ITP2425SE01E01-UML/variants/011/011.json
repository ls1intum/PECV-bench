      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares RollerCoaster.numberOfLoopings as type int (problem_statement.md lines 26-28), but the reference solution declares the attribute and its getter as double in RollerCoaster.java. This is a type mismatch for the core attribute and its accessor: students reading the UML expect an int, while the solution API exposes a double. This will confuse students about the correct attribute type and the expected return type of getNumberOfLoopings().",
