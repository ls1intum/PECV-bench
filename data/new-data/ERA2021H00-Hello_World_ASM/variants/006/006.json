      "description": "The solution implementation diverges structurally from the problem statement and the template: the template and problem expect a conventional NASM-style program with 'section .data' containing the 'hello' string, 'section .text', 'global main' and linking against printf (extern printf) with push hello / call printf. The solution instead declares only 'section .text', uses a different global label 'CMAIN' (not 'main'), omits the data section and the extern printf / push/call sequence, and appears tailored for a different assembler/runtime (SASM). This mismatch can confuse students who look at the solution to verify the intended final state — they may copy or compare against the solution and find the program does not print 'Hello World!' or uses a different entry symbol, leading to uncertainty about which symbol name and linking conventions are required for the course Makefile and environment.",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the solution mirror the template/problem environment so students can use it as a direct reference. Specifically, in solution_repository/helloWorld.asm replace 'global CMAIN' / 'CMAIN:' with 'global main' / 'main:', add a 'section .data' with the hello string and the 'extern printf' declaration, and use the push hello / call printf / add esp, 4 sequence (while keeping the corrected instruction 'add eax, ecx'). Alternatively, if the solution intentionally targets a different assembler/environment (SASM), clarify this in the problem statement and label the solution as an environment-specific example so students are not misled."
