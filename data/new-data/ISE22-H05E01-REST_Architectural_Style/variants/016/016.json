      "description": "The Person model's field visibility differs between template and solution. In the template repository Person.java declares fields as private (with getters/setters). In the solution repository Person.java the same fields are declared public (while still providing getters/setters). The problem statement's UML also presents the Person fields as private (prefixed with '-' in the UML). This visibility difference is an unintentional structural inconsistency that may confuse students who compare their template code with the provided solution or the UML in the problem description (and may encourage accessing fields directly instead of using accessors).",
