      "description": "The solution repository's PersonScene class introduces a direct dependency on the service layer (imports PersonService and declares a private final PersonService personService field) even though the template PersonScene (and the problem statement's MVC description) expects the view to interact only with the controller. Moreover, the solution's PersonScene declares the field as final but does not initialize it in the constructor, which will cause a compilation error. This deviates from the intended layered/MVC design described in the problem statement and is a structural error in the solution code that will confuse students comparing template and solution and will prevent the project from compiling.",

Preferably, restore strict MVC layering by letting the view communicate only with the controller (as described in the problem statement) to avoid violating the architecture and to ensure the code compiles."
