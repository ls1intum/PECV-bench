      "description": "The no-argument constructor of the Person class differs in visibility between the template and the solution. In the template repository Person() is declared public, while in the solution repository it is package-private (no explicit modifier). This difference is structural (visibility) rather than pedagogical and may confuse students who compare their starting code to the reference solution. It can also affect (de-)serialization or reflective instantiation in some environments and therefore is a potential source of unexpected behavior.",

The simplest fix is to declare a public no-arg constructor in the solution (public Person() {}) to match the template. Alternatively, if the package-private constructor is intentional, add a short comment in the problem statement and template explaining the choice so students are not surprised."
