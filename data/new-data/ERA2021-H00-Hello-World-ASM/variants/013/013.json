      "description": "The template file defines a label 'main' but the 'global main' directive is commented out (making 'main' local), while the solution uses a different entry symbol ('global CMAIN' / 'CMAIN:'). This mismatch in entry-symbol name and visibility across template and solution may confuse students about which symbol is the program entry point and whether they need to add a 'global' directive. The commented note in the template ('Visibility mismatch: main is now local') appears to be an accidental leftover rather than part of the exercise instructions.",

Options: (a) restore 'global main' in the template (uncomment the directive) and/or update the solution to use 'global main' / 'main' so both match, or (b) adjust the template to use 'CMAIN' and add 'global CMAIN' if that is the intended entry symbol. Also remove or clarify the stray comment about a 'Visibility mismatch' to avoid confusing students."
