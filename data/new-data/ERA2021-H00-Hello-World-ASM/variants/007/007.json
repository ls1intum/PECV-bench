The solution only shows the rename (add eax, ecx) but does not initialize eax beforehand. A student comparing the solution to the task description may be confused whether the initialization step is required or omitted intentionally; the solution does not reflect the full, required final state.",

      "description": "The template and solution use different entry symbols and program structure. The template declares 'global main', 'extern printf', and provides a data section with a 'hello' string and a push/call to printf. The solution instead declares 'global CMAIN' and label 'CMAIN' and contains only an add and ret, with no data/printf usage. This mismatch in symbol names and overall structure may confuse students about which symbol name the build system expects and which calling/printing convention to follow.",

If the solution intentionally targets a different assembler/runtime (e.g., SASM with CMAIN), document that clearly in the problem statement so students understand the difference."

This omission in the template comment may cause students to overlook the second required change.",
