      "description": "The createPerson handler method in PersonResource has different visibility between the template and the solution. In the template the method is declared public (template_repository/src/main/java/de/tum/in/ase/eist/rest/PersonResource.java, lines 37-43), while in the solution the same method is package-private (no access modifier) (solution_repository/src/main/java/de/tum/in/ase/eist/rest/PersonResource.java, lines 37-43). Although this does not change the method signature or parameters, it is a structural difference between the provided starter code and the reference implementation and may confuse students comparing both repositories about expected method visibility in controller classes.",

This mismatch in the endpoint path can confuse students when they try to invoke the described endpoints or write integration tests against the provided template: they may call the non-existent /api/... path or add an unnecessary base path to the controller.",
