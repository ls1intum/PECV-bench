 ### Part 3
 
 1. [task][Implement the Farm class](testMethods[Farm],testAttributes[Farm],farmConstructs(),getAnimalsTest())
-    Implement the class `Farm` according to the UML diagram. In a farm, there are a list of animals. The aggregation between Farm and Animal is realized using a `List`, implemented using an `ArrayList`. Initialize the ArrayList in a constructor with no arguments. Also, don't forget to implement a `getter` and a `setter`.
+    Implement the class `Farm` according to the UML diagram. In a farm, there are unique animals without duplicates. The aggregation between Farm and Animal is realized using a `Set`, implemented using a `HashSet`. Initialize the HashSet in a constructor with no arguments. Also, don't forget to implement a `getter` and a `setter`.
     - `addAnimal(Animal a)` adds an animal to the list. 
     - `feedAllAnimals()` calls `messageOnFeed()` on all animals in the Farm, printing out the message for each animal.
