    {
      "description": "The problem statement refers to a static method named `acceptSupplyDelivery` (lines 69 and 71 in problem_statement.md) and even names the test `testAcceptSupplyDelivery()`, but the UML diagram (line 30) and the solution implementation (SealSaloon.java) define the method as `receiveDelivery`. This inconsistency will confuse students about which method name to implement and how the tests will locate it.",
