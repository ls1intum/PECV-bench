      "description": "The problem statement explicitly instructs that calculateTotalPrice should be a static method in SealSaloon, but in the solution it is declared as an instance method. This mismatch between the required static modifier and the provided signature could confuse students about how to correctly declare and call calculateTotalPrice.",
