 We store all the needed ingredients for a Meal as an array with the names of ingredients. For example, a `Cowboy Stew` might have 2 x `"beans"`, 1 x `"bacon"`, and 2 x `"potatoes"`.

-The SealSaloon needs two attributes: a modifiable `Meal[]` attribute called `orders` and a `final Stock` stock (meaning that it is read-only after construction). These should be initialized to default values (e.g., an empty array or a new object of the class Stock) in the constructor of `SealSaloon`. Hereby, the constructor takes no parameters.
+The SealSaloon needs two attributes: a modifiable `List<Meal>` attribute called `orders` and a `final Stock` stock (meaning that it is read-only after construction). These should be initialized to default values (e.g., an empty list or a new object of the class Stock) in the constructor of `SealSaloon`. Hereby, the constructor takes no parameters.
 
 Now, let's implement all the logic of the new Seal Saloon. We will need `calculateTotalPrice` to calculate the net cost of the meal. `acceptSupplyDelivery` is invoked when our supply chain partner delivers fresh Ingredients for our meals. It takes the name, its price, and the delivered quantity as parameters.
 It increases the quantity of its corresponding `StockIngredient` object by the given value. Also, handle the case if no ingredient with the given name exists yet: Create a new object and add it to the stock.
