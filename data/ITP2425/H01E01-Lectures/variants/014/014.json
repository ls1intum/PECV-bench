      "description": "The UML diagram in the problem statement declares numberOfInscribedStudents and numberOfGuestStudents as double, but the solution implementation uses int for these fields. If students follow the UML exactly, they will define wrong types and face compilation errors when integrating with the provided solution and tests.",

Either update the UML in the problem statement to use int for these fields (matching the solution), or change the solution and template to use double for numberOfInscribedStudents and numberOfGuestStudents if doubles are indeed intended."
