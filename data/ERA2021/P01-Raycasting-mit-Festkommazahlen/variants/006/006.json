      "description": "The problem statement specifies that fix_add takes three arguments (a destination register, first operand, second operand), but both the template and solution implementations of fix_add_asm actually expect four 32-bit arguments (two 64-bit operands passed as low/high words) and return the 64-bit result in EAX:EDX rather than writing to a specified register. This mismatch in the number and meaning of parameters will confuse students when trying to invoke or implement the function.",
