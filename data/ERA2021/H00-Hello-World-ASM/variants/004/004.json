      "description": "The template repository’s ASM file references the register “ecc”, while both the problem statement and the solution use the correct register name “ecx”. Students directed to rename “ecc” to “ecx” may be confused if the template and solution aren’t aligned. This inconsistency forces students to map two different identifiers to the same concept, adding unnecessary cognitive load.",
