 In this exercise, we are looking at a Spring Boot application that provides functionality to persist persons and create parent-child relationships between different persons.

 ## Part 4: Implement new functionality
 
-Now that you have deployed the first version of your application, you decide to improve the application and deploy an updated version. In this part, you should implement functionality to create and persist parent-child relationships between persons.

 - `addChild(Person person, Person child)`: `child` has to have two parents at most before adding a child. Add `child` to the `parent`'s list of children. Save and return the changed and persisted `person`.
 - `removeParent(Person person, Person parent)`: `person` has to have a number of parents greater than 1 before removing the parent. Remove `parent` from the `person`'s list of parents. Save and return the changed and persisted `person`.

 ***Important: You only have to save the parent-child in one direction. E.g., `addParent(person: Person, parent: Person)` only has to add `parent` to the list of parents of `child`, and not `child` to the list of children of `parent`. Saving the updated person to the database (with PersonRepository), Spring automatically sets this reference.***
