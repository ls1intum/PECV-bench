 In this exercise, we are looking at a Spring Boot application that provides functionality to persist persons and create parent-child relationships between different persons.

 ### Adding a feature
 [task][Implement PersonService](addChild(),addChildThrows(),addParent(),addParentThrows(),removeChild(),removeChildThrows(),removeParent(),removeParentThrows())
 You have to complete the implementation of some methods in `PersonService`. In case the following respective condition is not fulfilled, each method should throw an exception of type `ResponseStatusException` with status code 400 (Bad Request):
-- `addParent(Person person, Person parent)`: After adding `parent` to `person`, `person` has to have 2 parents at most. `parent` should be added to the `person`'s list of parents. Afterward, `person` should be saved to the database by calling `save(..)` from `personRepository`. `addParent` should return the result of this method call.
+- `linkParent(Person person, Person parent)`: After adding `parent` to `person`, `person` has to have 2 parents at most. `parent` should be added to the `person`'s list of parents. Afterward, `person` should be saved to the database by calling `save(..)` from `personRepository`. `linkParent` should return the result of this method call.
 - `addChild(Person person, Person child)`: `child` has to have two parents at most before adding a child. Add `child` to the `parent`'s list of children. Save and return the changed and persisted `person`.
 - `removeParent(Person person, Person parent)`: `person` has to have a number of parents greater than 1 before removing the parent. Remove `parent` from the `person`'s list of parents. Save and return the changed and persisted `person`.
 - `removeChild(Person person, Person child)`: `child` has to have a number of parents greater than 1 before removing the child. Remove `child` from the `person`'s list of children. Save and return the changed and persisted `person`.

-***Important: You only have to save the parent-child in one direction. E.g., `addParent(person: Person, parent: Person)` only has to add `parent` to the list of parents of `child`, and not `child` to the list of children of `parent`. Saving the updated person to the database (with PersonRepository), Spring automatically sets this reference.***
