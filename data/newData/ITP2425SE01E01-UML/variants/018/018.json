      "description": "The problem statement (UML and tasks) consistently refers to the park class as \"ExcellencePark\" (UML class and task names), while the repository template and reference solution use the class/file name \"ExcellenceLand\" (ExcellenceLand.java). Additionally, the exercise title/header uses \"Excellence Land\", increasing the naming inconsistency. This mismatch between the class name in the specification and the actual template/solution will confuse students about which class to implement and/or which name the tests expect.",

Also update any task/test names that reference ExcellencePark/ExcellenceLand to the chosen name.\nEnsure the class name used in the UML, task descriptions, template files, and tests is identical so students are not confused which class to implement."

Alternatively, rename the template and solution class files to \"ExcellencePark\" if you prefer that name, but ensure all tasks, UML, template files, and tests consistently use the same identifier."
