      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares Ride's attributes with protected visibility (#name: String, #abbreviation: char), while the reference solution (and the typical expected student implementation) declare these attributes as private. The textual instructions require public getters but do not explicitly state the attribute visibility. This mismatch between the UML visibility marker and the actual/expected implementation can confuse students about whether they must make the attributes protected or private.",
