      "description": "The UML/problem statement defines the Pneumatic interface with methods raisePressure(int) and openValve(). In the solution repository, Pneumatic declares raisePressure(int) and releasePressure() (i.e. it uses releasePressure instead of openValve). The concrete classes in the solution (LaunchedDropdownTower, LaunchedRollerCoaster) implement openValve(), so the solution as provided is internally inconsistent and does not match the problem UML. This mismatch in the interface method name/signature will confuse students about which method to declare/implement and prevents the provided solution from compiling without edits.",

Remove or replace releasePressure() in the solution. Then ensure all implementations (LaunchedDropdownTower, LaunchedRollerCoaster) implement openValve(). Alternatively, if releasePressure() was intended, update the problem statement/UML and task descriptions to specify releasePressure() instead of openValve(). Aligning names across problem, template and solution will resolve the inconsistency."

This naming divergence between the problem UML and the solution code will confuse students (they are told to implement/openValve) and may cause compilation or mapping issues because the interface and implementations do not agree on the method name.",
