 ## The system
 Heroku runs a Docker container and a Postgres database. This Docker container contains our hosted Spring Boot application which uses functionality provided by Postgres (`Postgres API`) using a [socket and SQL-statements](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/connecting-heroku-postgres#connecting-in-java). A client (e.g. your local machine) can invoke HTTP requests to access functionality that your Spring Boot application provides (`Person REST API`). The Spring Boot application consists of three different layers:
-- Web Layer: This layer contains `PersonResource` which provides HTTP(-REST) endpoints to the client.
+- Web Layer: This layer contains `PersonResource` which provides HTTP(-REST) endpoints to the client. The endpoint `GET /persons` returns a **Set** of all persons. The `GET /persons` endpoint returns a **Set** of all persons.
 - Application Layer: This layer contains `PersonService` which provides business logic to `PersonResource`.
 - Persistence Layer: This layer contains `PersonRepository` which provides functionality to perform database actions regarding entities of type `Person`. This layer uses functionality of the connected Postgres database.

 - `addChild(Person person, Person child)`: `child` has to have two parents at most before adding a child. Add `child` to the `parent`'s list of children. Save and return the changed and persisted `person`.
 - `removeParent(Person person, Person parent)`: `person` has to have a number of parents greater than 1 before removing the parent. Remove `parent` from the `person`'s list of parents. Save and return the changed and persisted `person`.

 ***Important: You only have to save the parent-child in one direction. E.g., `addParent(person: Person, parent: Person)` only has to add `parent` to the list of parents of `child`, and not `child` to the list of children of `parent`. Saving the updated person to the database (with PersonRepository), Spring automatically sets this reference.***
