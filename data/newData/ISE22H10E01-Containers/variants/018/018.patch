 ## The system
 Heroku runs a Docker container and a Postgres database. This Docker container contains our hosted Spring Boot application which uses functionality provided by Postgres (`Postgres API`) using a [socket and SQL-statements](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/connecting-heroku-postgres#connecting-in-java). A client (e.g. your local machine) can invoke HTTP requests to access functionality that your Spring Boot application provides (`Person REST API`). The Spring Boot application consists of three different layers:
-- Web Layer: This layer contains `PersonResource` which provides HTTP(-REST) endpoints to the client.
-- Application Layer: This layer contains `PersonService` which provides business logic to `PersonResource`.
+- Web Layer: This layer contains `PersonController` which provides HTTP(-REST) endpoints to the client.
+- Application Layer: This layer contains `PersonService` which provides business logic to `PersonController`.
 - Persistence Layer: This layer contains `PersonRepository` which provides functionality to perform database actions regarding entities of type `Person`. This layer uses functionality of the connected Postgres database.

 ***Important: You only have to save the parent-child in one direction. E.g., `addParent(person: Person, parent: Person)` only has to add `parent` to the list of parents of `child`, and not `child` to the list of children of `parent`. Saving the updated person to the database (with PersonRepository), Spring automatically sets this reference.***

 ***Note 2: You will have to use an instance of `ObjectMapper` to serialize the instances of `Person` (example provided). You have to use the attribute named `objectMapper` in `PersonIntegrationTest`. Don't create and use a new instance of `ObjectMapper`, nor delete the existing one!***
 
-To make sure that the whole system works correctly, you should write two integration tests in `PersonIntegrationTest`. These tests basically test the same functionality, but at the full scope of the system (instead of only the service and repository). Therefore, instead of invoking the methods of `PersonService` directly, we will invoke the REST endpoints of `PersonResource`. You should use [Spring MockMVC](https://www.baeldung.com/integration-testing-in-spring#Writing) to invoke the endpoints.

 `PersonIntegrationTests` already contains two test cases that you can use as a reference, and in which you should implement the following test cases:
 - `testAddParent`: Perform the same test setup and assertions as in `PersonServiceTest`, but instead of invoking `PersonService::addParent`, you should invoke the endpoint `PUT /api/persons/{personId}/parents` and pass the respective parent as the content.
 - `testAddThreeParents`: Instead of invoking `PersonService::addParent`, you should invoke the endpoint `PUT /api/persons/{personId}/parents` and pass the respective parent as a the content.
