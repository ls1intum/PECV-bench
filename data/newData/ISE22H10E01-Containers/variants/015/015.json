      "description": "The handler method for creating a person in PersonResource differs in visibility between the template and the solution. In the template the createPerson(...) method is declared public, while in the solution it is package-private (no access modifier). Controller handler methods are typically public and this mismatch may confuse students about the intended visibility of REST endpoint methods and whether Spring requires them to be public.",

Prefer declaring controller handler methods as public (e.g., change the solution's createPerson(...) signature to public ResponseEntity<Person> createPerson(...)) so students clearly see the intended visibility and avoid uncertainty about Spring's requirements for handler method access levels."
