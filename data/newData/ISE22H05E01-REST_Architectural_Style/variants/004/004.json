      "description": "Resource path naming is inconsistent between the problem statement and the solution server: the problem statement specifies endpoints under /persons (POST /persons, GET /persons, PUT /persons/{personId}, DELETE /persons/{personId}), but the solution's server implementation exposes the endpoints under /people (e.g. @GetMapping(\"people\"), @PostMapping(\"people\")). This is a cross-artifact conflict that will confuse students about which path to implement and test against, and may cause students to implement endpoints at /persons while the reference server uses /people (or vice versa).",

The problem statement explicitly lists the REST paths as /persons (POST /persons, GET /persons, PUT /persons/{personId}, DELETE /persons/{personId}) but the solution server implements the endpoints under the path \"people\" (e.g. @GetMapping(\"people\"), @PostMapping(\"people\"), @PutMapping(\"people/{personId}\")). The solution client is also inconsistent: some client methods call the server under \"people\" (add/update use \"people/...\"), while others use \"persons\" (getAll and delete use \"persons/...\" in the provided client implementation). The template contains the PersonController/PersonResource stubs but no endpoints yet, which leaves students to map the problem description to the template — the differing names between problem and solution (and the mixed usage within the solution client) will create confusion and integration errors. Students following the problem statement and template would expect and implement /persons, but the server in the solution expects /people; additionally the mixed URIs in the solution client will lead to runtime mismatches. This inconsistent naming for the same conceptual entity (persons/people) creates a high cognitive and practical integration burden.",
