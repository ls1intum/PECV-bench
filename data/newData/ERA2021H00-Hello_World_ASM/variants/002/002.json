      "description": "The problem statement requires that the process exit/status code be returned in the EBX register (problem_statement.md line 22), but neither the template nor the solution set EBX before returning. The template's main simply returns (ret) after calling printf and the solution returns (ret) as well without placing a status in EBX. If the grader or testing infrastructure expects the status in EBX, students following the template will not meet that requirement and may be confused why their submission fails despite following the exercise (which is intended to be only a small textual fix).",

Ensure the grader and Makefile are aligned with whichever convention is chosen."

This mismatch in the declared global/entry symbol between template and solution may confuse students about which entry label to use or how the provided Makefile/build expects the entry point to be named. If the build or testing expects one specific symbol, the other artifact will not directly match that expectation.",

At minimum, add a comment in the solution explaining why the I/O/data section is omitted (e.g., a reduced example focused on the intended fix) to avoid confusion."
