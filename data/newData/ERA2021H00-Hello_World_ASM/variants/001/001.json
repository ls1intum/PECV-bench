      "description": "The template and problem statement expect a global symbol named 'main' and provide a NASM-style program (section .data, extern printf, push/call printf). The solution repository instead defines a different entry symbol 'CMAIN' and omits the .data/printf usage, and includes comments referring to the SASM environment (io.inc, SASM macros). This is a cross-artifact structural mismatch: students following the template and problem (and the provided Makefile/runner) will look for/use 'main' and NASM calling conventions, while the solution uses a different entry point and assembler conventions. That can confuse students when they compare their (template-based) code to the provided solution, and may prevent direct verification against the provided Makefile or runtime.",

Concretely, change the solution's 'global CMAIN' / 'CMAIN:' to 'global main' / 'main:' and ensure the data/printf sequence is present (or update the problem statement to explicitly allow/describe the SASM/CMAIN variant)."

This names the same conceptual entity (the program's entry point) differently across artifacts, which can confuse students trying to map the problem requirements and the template to the reference solution.",

For example, rename the solution's 'global CMAIN' and 'CMAIN:' to 'global main' and 'main:' (and update any build/Makefile references if necessary), or alternatively update the problem statement and template to note that the solution uses 'CMAIN' as the entry label. Prefer using 'main' in the solution to match the problem and template so students can directly map the concepts."
