      "description": "The problem statement's UML diagram specifies the `getTotalNumberOfStudents()` method with public visibility (`+`), but the solution implements it with protected visibility. This mismatch could confuse students about the intended accessibility of this method, potentially leading them to implement it with incorrect visibility or causing issues if they try to access it from contexts where `protected` is not allowed (e.g., from the `Main` class if it's not in the same package or a subclass).",
