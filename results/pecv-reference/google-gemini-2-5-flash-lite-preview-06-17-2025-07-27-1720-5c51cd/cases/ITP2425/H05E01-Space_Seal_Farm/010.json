      "description": "The UML diagram in the problem statement specifies the `animals` attribute in the `Farm` class as private (`- animals: List<Animal>`). However, the solution implementation declares it as public (`public List<Animal> animals;`). This inconsistency could confuse students about the expected encapsulation of the `Farm` class's internal state, especially since the task also mentions implementing a getter and setter for this attribute.",
