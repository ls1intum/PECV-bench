      "description": "The getStockIngredients method in the Stock class has a return type mismatch between the template repository and the solution repository. The template defines it as returning List<StockIngredient>, while the solution defines it as returning StockIngredient[]. This discrepancy could confuse students who start with the template code and then find that the solution requires a different type, potentially leading them to question the intended design without clear guidance from the problem statement.",
