      "description": "The problem statement specifies that the calculateTotalPrice method in the SealSaloon class should return a double for accurate financial calculations, but the solution implementation returns an int, which could lead students to implement an incorrect type based on the solution reference, causing confusion about the intended precision for monetary values.",
