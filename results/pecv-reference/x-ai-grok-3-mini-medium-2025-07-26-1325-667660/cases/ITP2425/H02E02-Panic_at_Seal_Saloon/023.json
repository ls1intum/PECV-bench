      "description": "The problem statement specifies that the 'totalOrders' attribute in the SealSaloon class should be of type 'int', as indicated in the UML diagram. However, in the solution repository, it is declared as 'long'. This discrepancy could confuse students who follow the problem statement strictly, leading them to implement it as 'int' and wonder why the solution uses a different type, potentially causing compatibility issues if the type affects method behavior or grading.",
