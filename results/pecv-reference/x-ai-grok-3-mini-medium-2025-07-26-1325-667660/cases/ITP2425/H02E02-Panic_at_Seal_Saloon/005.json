      "description": "The problem statement specifies that the 'orders' attribute in the SealSaloon class should be a modifiable List<Meal>, as indicated in the UML diagram and task description. However, the solution repository implements it as a Meal[] array. This discrepancy could confuse students who follow the problem statement literally, especially since the template repository uses arrays in other contexts like ArrayHelpers, potentially leading them to question whether they should use a List or an array for this attribute.",
