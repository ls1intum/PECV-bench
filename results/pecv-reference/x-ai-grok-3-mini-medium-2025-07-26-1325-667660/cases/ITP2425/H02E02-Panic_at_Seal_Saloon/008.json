      "description": "The method calculateRemainingOrderNumber in the SealSaloon class is described in the problem statement and UML diagram as returning an integer (int) representing the number of remaining orders. However, in the solution repository, it is implemented as a void method that only prints output, which contradicts the specified return type. This inconsistency could confuse students who expect to implement a method that returns a value, potentially leading them to mismatch the design when comparing against the solution.",

For example, change the method signature to 'public int calculateRemainingOrderNumber()' and have it return the calculated number of orders, while preserving any printing logic if needed for demonstration."
