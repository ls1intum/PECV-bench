    {
      "description": "The problem statement specifies a method named 'calculateTotalPrice' in the SealSaloon class, but the solution repository implements it as 'computeMealCost' with the same parameters and return type. Additionally, the Main class in the solution repository attempts to call 'calculateTotalPrice', which does not exist, leading to compilation errors. This inconsistency could confuse students who follow the problem statement, as the solution code does not match the described design, potentially blocking them from understanding the intended implementation.",
