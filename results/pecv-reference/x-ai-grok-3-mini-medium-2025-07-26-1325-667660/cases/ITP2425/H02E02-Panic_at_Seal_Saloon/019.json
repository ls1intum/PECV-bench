      "description": "The problem statement specifies that the checkOrderReady() method in the SealSaloon class should return void, as indicated in the UML diagram. However, the solution implementation declares it as returning a boolean, which creates a discrepancy between the expected design and the provided solution. This could confuse students who are following the problem statement, potentially leading them to question the correct return type or feel that the template and solution are misaligned, even though the template doesn't include this method.",

      "description": "The problem statement refers to ingredient names in lowercase (e.g., 'bacon') as string literals in examples, while the solution code uses uppercase (e.g., 'Bacon') for the same conceptual entities in string arrays. This discrepancy in casing for ingredient names could create confusion for students, as Java string comparisons are case-sensitive, potentially leading to errors when mapping requirements to implementation.",
