    {
      "description": "The template repository declares attributes as public, while the problem statement's UML diagram specifies them as private, and the solution repository implements them as private. This discrepancy could confuse students about proper encapsulation and visibility modifiers, potentially leading them to implement attributes as public instead of private as intended by the exercise design.",
