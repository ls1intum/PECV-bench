      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares the attribute lectureName as type int (problem_statement.md lines 63-68), while the textual example for toString (problem_statement.md line 38) and the solution implementation (solution_repository/src/de/tum/cit/ase/Lecture.java lines 6-10) use lectureName as a String. This is a structural/type inconsistency: students reading the UML may implement lectureName as an int (following the UML) and then be confused when the example, expected behavior, and reference solution treat it as a String. This mismatch can cause compilation/test failures and significant confusion about the correct attribute type.",

Ensure the constructor signature and any examples in the problem text refer to lectureName as a String to match the intended design and the solution implementation.
