      "description": "The problem statement and UML refer to a Meal class (with constructor Meal(String, String[])) that is described as 'fully implemented'. The solution repository provides such a Meal class. However, the template repository does not contain an implemented Meal class \u2014 instead it contains an Order class with the same constructor and getters. The template also includes an empty Meal.java file. This mismatch (class name and presence) will confuse students: they expect a ready-to-use Meal type from the template but find either an empty Meal file or a differently-named Order class. Students may implement SealSaloon and other logic expecting to use Meal, so the unexpected Order class or missing Meal implementation is a structural inconsistency.",
