This is a method return-type mismatch that will confuse students about the expected API and cause them to implement a different signature than the reference solution/tests expect.",

Either: (A) change the problem statement/specification to say calculateRemainingOrderNumber() should be void and print the order numbers (matching the solution), or (B) modify the solution to implement calculateRemainingOrderNumber() as public int calculateRemainingOrderNumber() that returns this.orders.length (and, if desired, keep printing separately). Prefer option B if the intent is to supply the remaining-order count to other code/tests."

      "description": "The problem text initially instructs students to initialize the SealSaloon attributes (orders and stock) in the constructor, but immediately after requires the stock attribute to be static (shared across instances). Initializing a static final stock in an instance constructor contradicts the static requirement: static final fields must be assigned at declaration or in a static initializer, not in an instance constructor. This conflicting instruction can mislead students about where/how to initialize the stock field.",

Alternatively, if stock should be an instance (non-static) final field, remove the requirement that it be static. Update the problem statement to remove the contradictory instruction about initializing stock in the constructor when it is declared static."
