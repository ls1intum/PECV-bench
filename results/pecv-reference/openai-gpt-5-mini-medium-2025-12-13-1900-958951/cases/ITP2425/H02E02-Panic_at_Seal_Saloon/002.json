      "description": "The problem statement first instructs students to initialize both attributes (orders and stock) in the SealSaloon constructor (so they take no parameters and set defaults), but later explicitly requires the stock attribute to be static and final. Declaring stock as static final means it cannot be sensibly initialized in an instance constructor (static final fields must be initialized at declaration or in a static initializer). This contradiction can confuse students about where/how to initialize stock and can lead to compilation/design errors if they try to follow the earlier instruction literally.",

      "suggested_fix": "Disambiguate the instructions: either (A) require and document that stock is static final and should be initialized at the point of declaration or in a static initializer (not in the instance constructor), and instruct students to only initialize orders in the constructor; or (B) remove the static/final requirement for stock and keep the instruction to initialize it in the constructor. Prefer option (A) to match the provided solution: update the problem statement to explicitly say something like \"stock is a static final field; initialize it at declaration or in a static initializer. Initialize orders (the non-static field) in the SealSaloon constructor.\" Also mention that static final fields cannot be assigned inside an instance constructor to avoid student confusion."
