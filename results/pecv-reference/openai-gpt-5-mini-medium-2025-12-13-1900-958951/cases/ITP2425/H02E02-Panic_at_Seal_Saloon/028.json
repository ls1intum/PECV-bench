      "description": "The problem statement contains contradictory instructions about the SealSaloon.stock attribute: one place (lines describing the SealSaloon attributes and constructor) tells students to add a final Stock stock initialized in the constructor (an instance field), while a later note explicitly states that the stock attribute must be static and shared across all SealSaloon instances. This contradicts the implementation in the reference solution (which uses a static final Stock). Students can be confused whether to implement stock as an instance final field initialized in the constructor or as a static final field; implementing it as an instance field (per the earlier text) will make the later requirement (and the reference solution/tests) fail and block correct behavior (shared stock across instances).",

      "suggested_fix": "Resolve the contradiction by making one interpretation explicit. Recommended fix (matches the reference solution/tests): update the problem statement to state that stock is a static (shared) attribute \u2014 e.g. 'private static final Stock stock' \u2014 and that it should be initialized at declaration or in a static initializer (not in the instance constructor). Also clarify that acceptSupplyDelivery and calculateTotalPrice are static and operate on the shared stock. Alternatively, if the intended design was instance-level stock, remove the note requiring stock to be static and update the reference solution/tests accordingly. Ensure the problem text consistently references the chosen design so students are not blocked by conflicting instructions."
