      "description": "The problem statement's UML and textual description specify orderMeal(Meal) as a void method (no return value), but the solution implementation declares orderMeal(Meal) to return boolean. This is a signature mismatch that can confuse students about the expected method contract and return value. If students rely on the UML/specification they will implement a void method, but the solution/reference returns a boolean which is inconsistent with the specification and may mislead or cause issues when comparing implementations.",

Change the solution (and any template/reference) so orderMeal(Meal) is declared as public void orderMeal(Meal meal) and remove the boolean return statements (or, if a boolean return is intentionally desired, update the problem statement/UML to document the boolean return and its semantics). Prefer keeping the specification (void) and updating the solution implementation to return no value."
