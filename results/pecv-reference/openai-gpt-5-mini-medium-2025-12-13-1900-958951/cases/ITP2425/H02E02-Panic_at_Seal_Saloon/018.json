      "description": "The problem statement requires a method named checkOrderReady() (UML and textual instructions request orderMeal to call checkOrderReady()). The solution class SealSaloon.java does not implement checkOrderReady(); instead it implements a method named processOrders() and orderMeal() calls processOrders(). This is a structural mismatch in the public API the problem describes versus the solution implementation and can confuse students about which method to implement (and how their orderMeal should call it).",
