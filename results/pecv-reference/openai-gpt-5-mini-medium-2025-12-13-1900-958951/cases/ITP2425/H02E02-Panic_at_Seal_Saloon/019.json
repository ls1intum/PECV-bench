      "description": "Conflicting instructions about how the shared stock field should be initialized: the problem text tells students to initialize both 'orders' and 'stock' to default values in the SealSaloon constructor (constructor takes no parameters), but elsewhere in the problem statement it requires the 'stock' attribute to be static (shared across instances). Initializing a static final field in an instance constructor is misleading and can lead students to attempt an assignment that is inappropriate for a static final field. The solution implements the stock as a static final field initialized at declaration, which is correct, but the problem text's 'initialize in constructor' guidance contradicts the static requirement and will confuse students.",

      "suggested_fix": "Clarify the problem statement: state that 'stock' must be a static (and optionally final) field shared across all SealSaloon instances and should be initialized at its declaration or in a static initializer, not in the instance constructor. Alternatively, remove the instruction to initialize 'stock' in the constructor so students are not led to attempt assigning a static field in an instance constructor."

      "description": "The problem specification and UML declare checkOrderReady() as a void method, but the solution implementation declares checkOrderReady() returning boolean. This is a signature mismatch between the specification and the provided solution implementation. Students following the specification will implement a void method, while the solution/reference shows a different return type, which is a structural inconsistency that can confuse expectations about the method's contract.",

Change the solution's checkOrderReady() to return void and remove the boolean return value (keep the same behavior of serving orders and printing). Alternatively, if a return value indicating whether any orders were served is desired pedagogically, update the problem statement and UML to document that checkOrderReady() returns a boolean."
