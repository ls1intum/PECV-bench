      "description": "The problem statement instructs that the SealSaloon's stock and orders \"should be initialized to default values ... in the constructor of SealSaloon\" (which implies instance initialization), but later explicitly states that the stock attribute must be static (shared across instances) and also that the stock should be final. Initializing a static final field in an instance constructor is incorrect in Java and will confuse students whether stock should be an instance-final field assigned in the constructor or a static (class-level) field initialized at declaration or in a static initializer. The solution declares stock as a static final field and initializes it at declaration. This contradiction in the problem text about where/how to initialize stock can lead to compilation or design errors if students follow the constructor-initialization instruction while also attempting to make it static/final.",

      "suggested_fix": "Clarify the intended declaration and initialization of stock. Either (A) require a non-static final Stock stock initialized in the constructor (remove the later requirement that it be static), or (B) require a static (and optionally final) Stock stock that is initialized at the point of declaration or in a static initializer. Update the problem text (and UML if necessary) to state explicitly: \"private static final Stock stock = new Stock(); (initialized at declaration)\" or the chosen alternative. This removes ambiguity about assigning static/final fields in the constructor."

      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares totalOrders as an int (-totalOrders: int) while the reference solution declares totalOrders as a long. This is a type mismatch between the specification and the solution. Although using long is not likely to break functionality, it is a structural inconsistency between the UML/spec and the provided solution that may confuse students about the expected type.",
