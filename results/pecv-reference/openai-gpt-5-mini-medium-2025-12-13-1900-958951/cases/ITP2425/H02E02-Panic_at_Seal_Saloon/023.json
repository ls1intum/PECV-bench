    {
      "description": "The problem UML and textual specification declare the SealSaloon attribute totalOrders as an int, but the solution implementation uses a long for totalOrders (and its getter returns long). This is a type mismatch for a core attribute and its getter which may confuse students about the expected type and could cause tests or student implementations that follow the problem statement to diverge from the reference implementation.",

      "description": "The problem text instructs students to initialize the SealSaloon attributes (orders and stock) in the constructor, but elsewhere explicitly requires that the stock attribute be static (shared across instances). Initializing a static (class) field in an instance constructor is confusing and inconsistent with typical usage. The solution initializes the static stock at its declaration (private static final Stock stock = new Stock()). The conflict between 'initialize in constructor' and 'stock must be static' may confuse students about where and how to initialize the stock field.",
