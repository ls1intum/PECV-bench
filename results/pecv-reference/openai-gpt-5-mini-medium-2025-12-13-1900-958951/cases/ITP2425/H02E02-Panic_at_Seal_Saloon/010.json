      "description": "Method name/signature inconsistency for the meal-cost calculation: the problem statement UML and text refer to a static method calculateTotalPrice(Meal): int, but the template and solution repositories disagree about the name. The template's Main uses computeMealCost(...), the solution's SealSaloon implements computeMealCost(...), while the solution's Main calls calculateTotalPrice(...). This mismatch (different method names used across problem statement, template, and solution) is structural and will confuse students which method to implement and which name tests/main expect. It also causes the provided solution to be internally inconsistent (Main calls a method that SealSaloon does not provide).",

Ensure the method is static and returns an int as specified, and update all example usages in Main and template comments so the repository is internally consistent."

This mismatch between the expected method name in the exercise description and the actual method name in the codebase can confuse students: they may look for calculateTotalPrice to implement or call, while the provided Main and the solution implement/expect computeMealCost. The concept (computing the total price/cost of a Meal) is the same, but the differing identifiers create an unnecessary mapping burden.",
