      "description": "Constructor signature for StockIngredient differs between the problem specification, the template, and the solution. The problem UML and the solution expect a constructor StockIngredient(String, int, int) (3 parameters). The template repository instead provides only a 4-parameter constructor StockIngredient(String, int, int, boolean). This prevents students from instantiating StockIngredient using the 3-arg form shown in the problem statement and used in the solution (and in the commented example in Main), causing compilation issues or confusion about which constructor to use.",

A static field cannot be initialized per-instance in the instance constructor in the typical way implied earlier. This contradictory instruction can confuse students about where/how to declare and initialize the stock field (instance vs. static initialization).",

Declare stock as a static final field and initialize it at the declaration (e.g., private static final Stock stock = new Stock();).\" This removes the ambiguity about where the shared stock should be created."
