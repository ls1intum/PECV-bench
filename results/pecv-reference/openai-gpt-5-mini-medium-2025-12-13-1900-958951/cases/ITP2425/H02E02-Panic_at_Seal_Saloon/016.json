This mismatch (static vs. instance) can cause confusion for students about the expected method signature and may cause tests or example usages that call SealSaloon.calculateTotalPrice(...) statically to fail against the provided solution.",

      "description": "There is an internal inconsistency within the problem statement regarding whether certain SealSaloon methods/attributes should be static. The UML portion (lines 25-34) shows method signatures without indicating static-ness, while the textual requirements later (lines 77-81) explicitly state that stock, acceptSupplyDelivery and calculateTotalPrice must be static.
