      "description": "The problem text instructs students to initialize both attributes (orders and stock) in the SealSaloon constructor (problem_statement.md lines ~70-73). However, elsewhere in the same problem statement it explicitly requires the stock attribute to be static (problem_statement.md lines ~77-81). A static final field is class-wide and must be initialized at its declaration or in a static initializer, not in an instance constructor. This is an internal contradiction in the specification and will confuse students whether to implement stock as an instance final field initialized in the constructor or as a static final field initialized at declaration (the provided solution uses a static final stock initialized at declaration).",

If the intention is a single shared stock across all saloons, state that stock is 'static final' and specify that it should be initialized at declaration or in a static initializer (not in the instance constructor). If the intention is per-instance stock, remove the requirement that stock be static. Update the problem statement text (and UML if present) to consistently reflect the chosen design."

In the reference solution, acceptSupplyDelivery is declared without an access modifier (package-private) while being static (solution SealSaloon.java lines ~47-55).
