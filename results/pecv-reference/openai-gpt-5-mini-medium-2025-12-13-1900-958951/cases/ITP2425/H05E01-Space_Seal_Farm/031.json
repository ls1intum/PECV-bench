      "description": "The problem statement explicitly requires the Animal name getter and setter to have protected visibility (UML shows '#' and the text note in Part 1). The solution implementation, however, declares getName() and setName(...) as public (Animal.java), and also declares the Animal constructor as public while the UML shows a protected constructor. This is a structural visibility mismatch: students following the specification would implement protected accessors, but the provided solution uses public accessors, which contradicts the specification and may confuse students about the intended encapsulation.",

Alternatively, if public accessors were intentional, update the problem statement/UML to state that the getter and setter are public so the specification and solution align."
