      "description": "The problem statement (UML) specifies that Animal has an attribute 'name' of type String, but the solution implementation declares the backing field as a StringBuilder (private StringBuilder name). This is a structural mismatch in the attribute type. Students following the UML and implementing Animal with a private String field (the expected/typical design) will find the solution diverges. If automated tests check the declared field type or students compare their code to the solution, this difference will cause confusion or test mismatches.",

Keep the public getter returning String and the setter accepting a String. Alternatively, update the problem statement/UML to explicitly allow a StringBuilder backing field, but the simpler fix is to change the solution to use String to avoid confusing students."
