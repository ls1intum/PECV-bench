      "description": "The problem statement and UML refer to an interface named 'Rideable' (with method messageOnRide()), and the template/Main comments also reference 'Rideable'. However, the solution implementation does not implement or use a functional 'Rideable' interface: there is an empty Rideable.java in the solution and the solution instead declares/uses an interface named 'Mountable' (Mountable.java) which is implemented by Pig and Seal. This renaming / missing interface causes a type-name mismatch and an absent Rideable contract. Students following the problem statement (or the template comments) will implement a 'Rideable' interface, but the solution's classes use 'Mountable' \u2014 and the provided Rideable.java is empty \u2014 which is a structural inconsistency that will cause confusion and may prevent compilation or correct linking if students compare against the solution or try to use the provided solution files as reference.",

Alternatively, update the problem statement and template to reference 'Mountable' instead of 'Rideable' (less recommended). This preserves the intended teaching goal while removing confusion."

In the solution repository that same concept is implemented under a different interface name 'Mountable' (solution/src/de/tum/cit/ase/Mountable.java) and the solution classes Pig and Seal implement Mountable. Additionally, solution/src/de/tum/cit/ase/Rideable.java is present but empty. This mismatch (Rideable vs. Mountable) breaks the one-to-one mapping between the exercise description/template and the provided solution, creating confusion about which interface students should implement/use and risking failing or misleading tests that expect the 'Rideable' identifier.",
