Alternatively, if the solution's use of String is intentional, update the problem text to remove the StringBuilder requirement so all artifacts are consistent."

This is an unintentional semantic inconsistency about the same conceptual entity (the Animal's name) across artifacts and creates confusion for students: they are told to implement the attribute using StringBuilder but the reference solution and UML indicate a plain String, and the template Main uses constructors that pass String literals. Students may waste time deciding which representation to use or implement code incompatible with tests or the provided solution.",

Update constructors and any call sites (Main and tests) to construct/convert accordingly.\n\n2) If String was intended (simpler/consistent with UML and solution): remove or correct the textual instruction that requires StringBuilder in the problem statement so it instructs using String (or does not mandate StringBuilder). Ensure the problem statement, UML, template comments, and solution are all aligned on 'String' for the name attribute.\n\nMake sure the chosen representation is reflected in example code in Main, the UML, and the exercise text so students have a single, unambiguous target to implement."
