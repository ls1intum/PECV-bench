      "description": "Visibility of Farm.singFarmSongVerse differs between the problem/template and the solution. The UML in the problem statement (and the template stub) indicates singFarmSongVerse is a private method (shown as '-' in the UML and provided as private in the template), but the solution implements it as protected. This mismatch in visibility is structural (not just a missing body) and could confuse students about the intended encapsulation of the helper method and about the expected signature when they implement the Farm class.",

The simplest fix preserving the UML intent is to change the solution's singFarmSongVerse visibility from protected to private and keep the Animal parameter, so it matches the UML and the template stub. Alternatively, if the design intentionally requires protected visibility, update the problem statement UML and the template stub to show protected visibility so all artifacts are consistent."
