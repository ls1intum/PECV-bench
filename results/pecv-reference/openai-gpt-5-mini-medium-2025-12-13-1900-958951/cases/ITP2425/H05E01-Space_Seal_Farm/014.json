      "description": "Template repository's Farm.java does not define the expected type 'Farm' described in the problem statement and shown in the solution. Instead the file declares a public class named 'AnimalFarm' and contains duplicated/embedded package and class declarations inside a method, which makes the template syntactically invalid and prevents students from implementing or compiling the intended design (the Main class and the exercise text expect a class named 'Farm' with methods such as addAnimal, feedAllAnimals, singFarmSong()). This is a structural/type mismatch between the problem specification and the template and is not an intentional pedagogical gap.",

Remove the duplicated/embedded 'package' and 'public class' fragments inside methods so the file compiles. Provide the expected structure/signatures (private List<Animal> animals; public Farm(); public void addAnimal(Animal a); public void feedAllAnimals(); public void singFarmSong(); and the private singFarmSongVerse(Animal animal) helper). This will align the template with the problem statement and the solution, allowing students to implement the missing classes and methods without being blocked by syntax/type errors."

      "description": "The problem statement and UML consistently refer to a class named 'Farm' (the central class that holds animals and provides methods like addAnimal, feedAllAnimals, singFarmSong). In the template repository the provided file is template_repository/src/de/tum/cit/ase/Farm.java but the class declared in that file is named 'AnimalFarm'. The solution repository implements the expected class as 'Farm'. This naming mismatch (Farm vs AnimalFarm, plus the file name/class name mismatch in the template) creates a direct mapping problem: students reading the problem will try to implement/extend 'Farm' and follow examples in Main (which reference Farm), but the starter code provides a differently named class, leading to confusion and compilation errors.",
