      "description": "The problem statement is inconsistent about the collection type used to store animals in Farm: the UML diagram shows animals: List<Animal> (implying a List), while the textual Part 3 explicitly requires a Set implemented as a HashSet (to ensure unique animals). The provided solution implements animals as a List (ArrayList). This mismatch (UML vs textual instruction vs solution) can confuse students about which collection to use and whether uniqueness of animals is required; it also affects the concrete implementation they must write (imports, constructor initialization, getter/setter types, and behavior of addAnimal).",

Two options (choose one to preserve pedagogical intent):\n\nOption A (teach HashSet / uniqueness): Update the UML and solution/template to use Set<Animal> and initialize with a HashSet. Concretely, change the Farm attribute to \"private Set<Animal> animals;\", add \"import java.util.HashSet; import java.util.Set;\", and initialize with \"this.animals = new HashSet<>();\". Update getter/setter signatures to use Set<Animal>.\n\nOption B (teach List / ordered collection): If the UML's List was intended, update the textual Part 3 to remove the HashSet/Set requirement and explicitly state that a List/ArrayList is used (and whether duplicates are allowed). Ensure template and solution text reflect this.\n\nApply the chosen change to the problem_statement.md, the template Farm.java (provide corresponding imports and field type), and the reference solution so students see a consistent design and aren't blocked or confused when implementing addAnimal, feedAllAnimals, and singFarmSong."

      "description": "The conceptual entity 'collection of animals' is referred to with different collection types across artifacts: the UML in the problem statement declares animals: List<Animal> (problem_statement.md, UML), the textual task description explicitly instructs to use a Set implemented with a HashSet (problem_statement.md, Part 3), while the provided solution uses a List backed by an ArrayList (solution_repository/src/de/tum/cit/ase/Farm.java). The template Farm.java does not provide a concrete collection but leaves a TODO, which leaves students unclear which collection type to use. This mismatch between List vs Set (and ArrayList vs HashSet) can confuse students about the intended data structure, and may cause implementations that fail automated checks or deviate from the stated requirements.",

Preferred fixes:\n- If the textual requirement (unique animals, no duplicates) is intended: update UML and solution to use Set<Animal> and initialize with new HashSet<>() (change field to private Set<Animal> animals; import java.util.Set and java.util.HashSet; constructor this.animals = new HashSet<>(); adjust getter/setter signatures accordingly). Also update the template Farm.java to define the Set field and constructor stub.\n- If the UML/List usage is desired: change the Part 3 textual description to say List/ArrayList and update the explicit instruction to remove the HashSet requirement so all artifacts consistently use List/ArrayList.\nAligning all three (UML, textual instructions, and implementation) will remove the cognitive burden and prevent incorrect student implementations."
