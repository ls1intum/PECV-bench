      "description": "The problem text explicitly instructs students to implement the helper method singFarmSongVerse(Animal animal) as public for easier testing (problem_statement.md lines 112-116). However, the template defines singFarmSongVerse as a private method with its parameter commented out (template_repository/src/de/tum/cit/ase/Farm.java line 18) and the solution also implements it as private (solution_repository/src/de/tum/cit/ase/Farm.java lines 33-54). This is a signature & visibility mismatch: the template/solution provide a private, parameterless method stub while the task text requires a public method that accepts an Animal parameter. Students following the textual instruction will be confused by the provided private/no-parameter stub and automated tests that expect a public method with the Animal parameter may fail.",
