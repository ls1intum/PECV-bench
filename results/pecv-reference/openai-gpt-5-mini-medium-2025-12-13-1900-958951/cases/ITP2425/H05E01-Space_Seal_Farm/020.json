      "description": "The problem statement requires the Farm to hold its animals in a List implemented using an ArrayList (initialize the ArrayList in a no-arg constructor). The reference solution, however, uses a Queue<Animal> backed by a LinkedList (imports LinkedList and Queue, declares animals as Queue<Animal>, and exposes getter/setter returning Queue<Animal>). This is a mismatch in the type of the collection used to model the Farm's animals and in the getter/setter signatures. Students following the problem text (implementing with List/ArrayList) would produce a different API than the solution, which may confuse grading, tests, or expected method/field types.",

This keeps the API aligned with the problem text and UML. OR\n2) Relax the problem statement to allow any Collection (or Queue/LinkedList) and remove the explicit requirement to use ArrayList so the solution's Queue/LinkedList design is acceptable. Prefer option (1) to preserve the stated learning goal of using List/ArrayList."

      "description": "The problem statement explicitly requires the Farm to use a List implemented with an ArrayList for the aggregation of Animal instances, and to initialize that ArrayList in the no-argument constructor. The reference solution, however, models the same conceptual attribute as a Queue<Animal> backed by a LinkedList (declaration and constructor use Queue/LinkedList; getter/setter also use Queue). This is an inconsistency in how the same conceptual entity (the collection of animals on a farm) is named/typed across artifacts. Students reading the instructions will expect List/ArrayList and might implement getters/setters or tests using List<Animal>/ArrayList, while the solution (and possibly tests) uses Queue/LinkedList, causing unnecessary confusion about the required type and the expected getter/setter signatures.",
