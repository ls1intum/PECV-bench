      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares Farm.animals as a private attribute (\"- animals: List<Animal)\") and the task text explicitly asks students to implement a getter and setter for the Farm's animals. However, the solution implementation declares the field as public (public List<Animal> animals;). This is a visibility mismatch: the solution exposes the collection directly instead of keeping it encapsulated behind private visibility and accessors. Students following the UML/instructions will implement animals as private with getters/setters; the public field in the solution contradicts that and may confuse students about the intended encapsulation and best practice being taught.",

This aligns the solution with the UML and the task text (teach encapsulation via private attributes + getter/setter). Alternatively, update the problem statement/UML to explicitly show a public attribute if exposing the list intentionally, but the preferred fix is to make the field private in the solution."
