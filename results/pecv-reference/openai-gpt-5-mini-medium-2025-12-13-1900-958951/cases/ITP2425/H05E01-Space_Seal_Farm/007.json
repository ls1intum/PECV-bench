      "description": "The problem statement's UML marks Animal.messageOnFeed() as a public abstract method (\"+ messageOnFeed(): String\"), but the solution declares it as protected (protected abstract String messageOnFeed()). This is a visibility mismatch between the specification and the reference implementation. While Java allows subclasses to widen visibility when overriding (the subclasses in the solution override messageOnFeed() as public), the discrepancy can confuse students about the intended visibility (the UML uses '+') and may create uncertainty when they implement the abstract method themselves or when tests expect the method to be public.",

Either change the solution's abstract declaration to public (public abstract String messageOnFeed();) so it matches the UML and removes ambiguity, or update the problem statement/UML to indicate a protected abstract method if that was intended. The simpler corrective action is to make messageOnFeed() public in Animal so student expectations from the UML and typical API design (public abstract method) match the reference implementation."
