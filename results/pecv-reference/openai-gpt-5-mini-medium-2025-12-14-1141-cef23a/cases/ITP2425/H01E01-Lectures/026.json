      "description": "The UML in the problem statement defines getTotalNumberOfStudents() as returning an int, but the solution implementation returns a custom StudentCount type. The solution also adds a new StudentCount class that is not mentioned in the problem description or provided in the template. This mismatch changes the method's signature and forces other methods in the solution (getNameAndTotalNumberOfStudents and getNumberOfStudentsPerTutor) to use StudentCount.getValue(), which deviates from the UML and will confuse students about the expected return type and how to implement the method.",

Preferred fixes (choose one depending on intent):\n1) Align the solution with the UML/problem statement: change Lecture.getTotalNumberOfStudents() in the solution to return an int (sum of inscribed and guest students), update getNameAndTotalNumberOfStudents() and getNumberOfStudentsPerTutor() to use the int result, and remove the StudentCount class from the solution. Also ensure the template remains unchanged (students implement int-returning method).\n2) If the intention was to introduce a StudentCount type, update the problem statement UML and exercise text to mention StudentCount as the return type and add a StudentCount class to the template repository so students have the necessary type available. This keeps method signatures consistent across problem, template, and solution."

      "description": "The problem statement and UML explicitly specify getTotalNumberOfStudents(): int (a primitive integer). The solution repository introduces a new class StudentCount and implements getTotalNumberOfStudents() to return a StudentCount instance rather than an int. This introduces a new identifier (StudentCount) representing the same conceptual entity (the total number of students) but with a different type/name than described in the problem/UML. Students following the problem will expect an int return and no StudentCount helper class; the presence of StudentCount in the solution (and its absence from the template) creates a mapping confusion between the conceptual \"total number of students\" and the concrete identifier used in the solution.",
