The solution implementation, however, introduces a new class LectureName and declares the lectureName attribute as type LectureName. This is a cross-artifact type/name-level divergence for the same conceptual entity (the lecture's name). Additionally, the solution's getters/setters for lectureName are inconsistent with that change (the getter/setter signatures use String while the field is LectureName), which compounds the mapping confusion. Students expecting to implement a String-typed lectureName as shown in the UML will be unable to directly map the problem/template requirements to the solution representation.",
