      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares numberOfInscribedStudents and numberOfGuestStudents as type double, while the solution implementation uses int for these attributes and the UML methods (e.g. getTotalNumberOfStudents(): int, getNumberOfStudentsPerTutor(): int) expect integer results. This creates a type inconsistency: summing double fields but returning an int (as specified) is confusing and would force students to perform casts/truncation or question which type to use. The template leaves the attributes unspecified (TODO), so students have no clear authoritative type to follow. This mismatch can confuse students about the intended data types for student counts and about the correct return types for the aggregate methods.",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the types consistent across artifacts. Preferred fix (simpler and more semantically correct for counts): change the UML in problem_statement.md to declare numberOfInscribedStudents and numberOfGuestStudents as int (not double). Ensure the template Lecture.java TODOs and the exercise text mention int for these attributes. Alternatively, if fractional student counts were intended (unlikely), update the solution and UML method return types to use double for totals and per-tutor calculations, and document how rounding/casting should be handled."
