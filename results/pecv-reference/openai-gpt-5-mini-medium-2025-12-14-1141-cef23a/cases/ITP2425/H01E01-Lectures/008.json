      "description": "The problem statement asks students to implement public getters for each attribute (see tasks describing getters and setters). In the provided solution, two of these getters \u2014 getLectureName() and getNumberOfInscribedStudents() \u2014 are declared private. This is a visibility mismatch: tests and the exercise text expect these getters to be accessible (public). As written in the solution (and if the template were to provide the same signatures), students or automated tests that try to call these getters will be unable to access them, causing confusion and failing tests.",
