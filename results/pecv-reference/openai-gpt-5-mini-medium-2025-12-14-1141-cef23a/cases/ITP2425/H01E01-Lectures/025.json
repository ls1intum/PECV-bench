      "description": "The problem statement / UML specifies numberOfInscribedStudents as an int, but the solution declares numberOfInscribedStudents as a long. This is a cross-artifact attribute type mismatch: the UML (problem statement) and the expected method signatures imply int, while the solution uses long. This inconsistency will confuse students about the intended type and lead to signature/type mismatches in getters, setters and the constructor.",

In the solution the method is declared to return int but its implementation adds a long (numberOfInscribedStudents) and an int (numberOfGuestStudents). This leads to a long expression being returned from a method with an int return type (incompatible types) \u2014 a compile-time error and a structural inconsistency between attribute type and method return type.",
