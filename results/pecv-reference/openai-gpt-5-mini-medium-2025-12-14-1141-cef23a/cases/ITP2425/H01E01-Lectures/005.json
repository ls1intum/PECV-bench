    {
      "description": "The UML in the problem statement defines the attribute 'lectureName' as type int (problem_statement.md lines 63-68), but elsewhere the problem description and examples treat lectureName as textual (e.g. the toString example shows Lecture{lectureName='Introduction to Programming', ...} and methods such as getNameAndTotalNumberOfStudents() return a String). The solution implementation declares lectureName as a String. This inner-artifact type contradiction in the problem statement's UML can confuse students about the intended type for lectureName and which constructor/getter/setter signatures they should implement.",
