    {
      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares getTotalNumberOfStudents() as a public method (shown with a '+' in the class diagram), but the solution implementation declares this method as protected (protected int getTotalNumberOfStudents()). This visibility difference is a structural inconsistency: the method is expected to be public by the specification/tests but is not publicly accessible in the solution. This can confuse students about the intended access level and may cause external tests or other classes to be unable to call the method.",

Change the method signature in the solution to: public int getTotalNumberOfStudents() { ... }. Ensure the template and any instructions also reflect the public visibility so students and tests have the expected access."
