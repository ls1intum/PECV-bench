      "description": "Return-type mismatch for Stock.take(String): The problem statement UML and the solution implementation expect Stock.take to return an int (returning the remaining quantity or -1 on failure), but the template repository's Stock.take is declared to return boolean. This prevents students from implementing the SealSaloon logic as described (and as shown in the solution), because calls like stock.take(x) are used as integer comparisons (e.g., == -1) in the intended design. Students following the template will face compilation/type errors or will need to change the provided Stock API, which is a structural inconsistency rather than an intentional pedagogical gap.",

This keeps the provided template API aligned with the specification and the reference solution."
