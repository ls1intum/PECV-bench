      "description": "The problem text instructs students to initialize the stock attribute in the SealSaloon constructor (an instance initialization) while elsewhere it requires the stock attribute to be static (shared across all instances) and final. These two instructions conflict: a static final field must be initialized at declaration or in a static initializer, not in an instance constructor. This contradiction can confuse students about whether stock should be an instance or class-level field and where to initialize it.",

If stock is intended to be shared (static), state that explicitly and instruct students to initialize it at declaration or in a static initializer (e.g., private static final Stock stock = new Stock();). Alternatively, if the goal was an instance field, remove the requirement that stock be static. Do not instruct students to initialize a static final field in the instance constructor."
