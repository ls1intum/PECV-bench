This changes the method signature (additional parameter) compared to the specification and will confuse students about the intended API. Students implementing checkOrderReady() as described in the statement (no arguments) will produce a different public API than the solution, and any tests or references expecting the no-argument method would not match the solution signature.",

Alternatively, update the problem statement/UML to document the boolean parameter if that extra parameter is intentional."

Initializing a static shared field in an instance constructor is contradictory guidance. The solution declares stock as a static final field and initializes it at declaration rather than in the constructor. This inconsistency in the problem statement (initialize in constructor vs. static shared field) may confuse students about where and how to initialize the stock.",

Explicitly indicate that the shared static stock should be defined as static final and can be initialized at declaration, so students are not instructed to initialize a static field in the instance constructor."

This changes the method signature (adds a parameter) and therefore breaks the direct mapping between the UML/requirements and the implemented API.

If internal debug logging is desired, either (a) use a private overloaded helper like private void checkOrderReady(boolean enableLogging) and keep the public no-arg method delegating to it, or (b) control logging via a private field or logger so the public API matches the UML and student expectations. Also update all calls (e.g., orderMeal) to call checkOrderReady() with no arguments."
