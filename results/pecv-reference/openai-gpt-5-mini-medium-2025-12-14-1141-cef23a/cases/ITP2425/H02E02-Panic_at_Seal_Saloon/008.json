      "description": "The problem statement (UML and textual description) specifies calculateRemainingOrderNumber() should return an int (the number of remaining orders). However, the reference solution implements calculateRemainingOrderNumber() as a void method that prints order number lines instead of returning the remaining-order count. This is a signature/behavior mismatch that will confuse students about the expected method contract and may cause grading/tests to fail if they expect an int return value.",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the implementation and the specification consistent. Preferred fix: change the solution implementation of calculateRemainingOrderNumber() to return an int (the number of remaining orders) and avoid relying solely on printing. For example, return this.orders.length and, if printing is desired for demonstration, still print but return the integer. Alternatively, if the intended behavior is to print the queue indexes, update the problem statement/UML to indicate the method is void and prints the order numbers."
