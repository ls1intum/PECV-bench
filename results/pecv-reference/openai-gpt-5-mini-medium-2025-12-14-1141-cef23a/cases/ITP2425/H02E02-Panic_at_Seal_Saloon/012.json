      "description": "The problem statement and UML refer to a class named 'Stock' (and indicate the SealSaloon.stock attribute should be of type Stock), but the template repository provides a fully implemented class named Inventory that contains the methods and behavior described for Stock. Additionally, template contains an empty Stock.java file. The solution implementation uses Inventory (SealSaloon.stock is of type Inventory). This name/type mismatch (Stock vs Inventory) is a structural inconsistency that can confuse students: they may look for the Stock class and its API in the template, attempt to implement SealSaloon against a non-existent/empty Stock class, or be uncertain which type to use for the stock attribute and related static methods.",

Removing the empty Stock.java file from the template will also avoid confusion.

The provided template and the reference solution instead implement this functionality in a class named 'Inventory' (Inventory.java contains add, take, findStockIngredient, addToStockIngredients, emptyStock). Additionally, there is an empty Stock.java file in the template/solution tree, which increases ambiguity. This mismatch (Stock vs Inventory) creates a mapping problem: students reading the problem will look for/modify a 'Stock' implementation, but the working implementation is named 'Inventory'.

Preferred fixes (pick one):\n1) Rename Inventory -> Stock (rename the class and file Inventory.java to Stock.java) and remove the empty Stock.java, so the template and solution provide the class the problem statement describes. Update any references to Inventory in the solution (e.g., SealSaloon.stock) to use Stock. OR\n2) Update the problem statement and UML to use the name 'Inventory' everywhere instead of 'Stock' (and mention that the class provided is Inventory). This keeps the existing code but aligns the textual requirements.\nEither approach removes the 'Stock' vs 'Inventory' naming mismatch and reduces student confusion; option 1 (rename Inventory to Stock) is recommended because the problem text and UML currently use 'Stock'."
