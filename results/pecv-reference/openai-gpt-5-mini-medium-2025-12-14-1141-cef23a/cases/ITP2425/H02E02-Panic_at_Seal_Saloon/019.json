    {
      "description": "The problem statement / UML specifies checkOrderReady() as a void method (no return value), but the reference solution implements checkOrderReady() with the signature public boolean checkOrderReady(). This is a return-type mismatch: students reading the UML will implement a void method while the solution exposes a boolean return value. Having the solution differ from the specification can confuse students who compare their implementation to the reference and may lead to inconsistent usage of the method.",

Either change the solution's checkOrderReady() to return void (remove the boolean return value and keep the internal logic), or update the problem statement / UML to document that checkOrderReady() returns a boolean describing whether any orders were served. Preferably change the solution to public void checkOrderReady() to match the UML/instructions (if a boolean is useful internally, keep it as a local variable but do not expose it)."
