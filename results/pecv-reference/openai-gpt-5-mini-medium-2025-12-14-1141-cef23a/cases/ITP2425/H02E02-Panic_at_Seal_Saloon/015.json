      "description": "The problem statement's UML and text indicate that orderMeal should have a void return type (UML: +orderMeal(Meal): void), but the provided solution implementation declares orderMeal as returning boolean (public boolean orderMeal(Meal)). This is a cross-artifact method signature mismatch that can confuse students about the expected API and the method they should implement (whether to return a boolean or nothing).",

Either change the solution's orderMeal method to return void (and keep its current behavior), or update the problem statement/UML to indicate a boolean return type and describe the meaning of the boolean. Preferably, change the solution to public void orderMeal(Meal meal) so it matches the UML and prose (and then remove or adapt any code/tests that rely on the boolean return)."
