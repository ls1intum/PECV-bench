      "description": "The problem text asks for a \"modifiable List<Meal> attribute called orders\" (suggesting java.util.List) and instructs it should be initialized in the SealSaloon constructor. However, the provided solution uses a Meal[] array for orders (and the project helper ArrayHelpers works with arrays). This mismatch between 'List<Meal>' in the problem statement and 'Meal[]' in the solution/template is a structural inconsistency that can confuse students about which collection type to use and which APIs (List vs. array + ArrayHelpers) they should rely on.",

Favor arrays if the rest of the template uses arrays and ArrayHelpers, or switch helpers to use List if Lists are preferred."

      "description": "The problem statement instructs students to initialize the SealSaloon attributes (including a final Stock stock) in the instance constructor, but elsewhere explicitly requires that the stock attribute be static (shared across all instances). Initializing a static final field in an instance constructor is invalid in Java (static final must be assigned at declaration or in a static initializer). This is a contradictory instruction that will confuse students about how to declare and initialize the stock field.",

If stock should be an instance-level final field, remove the requirement that it be static.
