      "description": "The problem UML and textual description specify the attribute totalOrders as an int (instance field), but the solution implementation declares totalOrders as a long.

Initializing a static field in an instance constructor is contradictory. The reference solution declares stock as static final and initializes it at field declaration. This conflicting guidance can confuse students about where and how to initialize the shared stock attribute.",

For example, replace the sentence that requires initializing stock in the constructor with wording that explains stock is a shared static field and should be initialized statically (or left initialized in its declaration). This removes the contradiction and aligns the instructions with the reference solution."
