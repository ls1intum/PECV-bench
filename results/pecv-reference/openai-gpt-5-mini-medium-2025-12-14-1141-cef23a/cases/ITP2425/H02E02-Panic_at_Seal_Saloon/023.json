      "description": "The problem statement gives contradictory guidance about the SealSaloon.stock attribute. One section (lines describing required attributes and the constructor) says SealSaloon should have a final Stock stock that is initialized in the constructor (implying an instance field). Later the text explicitly states the stock attribute must be static (shared across all instances). The reference solution implements stock as a static final field. This conflict (instance final vs static final and where it should be initialized) will confuse students about whether to declare stock as an instance field initialized in the constructor or as a static field, and may cause them to implement the class incorrectly relative to the tests and reference solution.",

      "suggested_fix": "Clarify and make the specification consistent. Either: (A) Require a shared stock and state explicitly that stock is a static field (e.g. \"private static final Stock stock = new Stock();\"), and remove the instruction that it must be initialized in the instance constructor; or (B) require an instance final Stock initialized in the constructor and remove the text saying stock must be static. Prefer option (A) to match the reference solution and the intent that the stock is shared across all saloons. Update the problem text and UML accordingly (and mention that getStock/acceptSupplyDelivery/calculateTotalPrice operate on the static stock)."
