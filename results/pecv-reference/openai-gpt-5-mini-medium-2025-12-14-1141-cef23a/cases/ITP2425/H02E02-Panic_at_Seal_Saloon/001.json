      "description": "The problem statement and UML require SealSaloon.calculateTotalPrice(Meal) to return double (the statement explicitly mentions double precision), but the solution implementation declares calculateTotalPrice as returning int. This mismatch in the method return type is a structural inconsistency: students following the problem description would implement/expect a double return type, while the provided solution (and possibly tests) use an int. This can cause confusion about the correct signature and lead to compilation/test failures if signatures differ between student code and reference tests.",

Either change the solution (and any tests) so calculateTotalPrice returns double (preferred to match the problem description) by updating the signature to 'public static double calculateTotalPrice(Meal meal)' and computing the sum as double, or update the problem statement/UML to specify an int return type if integer pricing is intended. Ensure the final signature in the template, solution, and tests all match (static modifier preserved as required)."
