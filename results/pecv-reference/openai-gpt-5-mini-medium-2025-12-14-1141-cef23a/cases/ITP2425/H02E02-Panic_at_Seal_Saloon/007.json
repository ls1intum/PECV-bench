The solution implementation instead provides a static method named receiveDelivery(String, int, int). This name/signature mismatch is structural: students reading the solution or tests expecting acceptSupplyDelivery will be confused or may implement the wrong method name. The implemented behavior matches the specification, but the method name differs.",
