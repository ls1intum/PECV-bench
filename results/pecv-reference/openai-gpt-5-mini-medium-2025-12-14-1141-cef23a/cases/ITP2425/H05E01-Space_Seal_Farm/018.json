      "description": "The problem statement and the template expect a public method named singFarmSong() in Farm (used to play the Old MacDonald song), but the solution implementation provides a public method named playFarmSong() instead. This is a method-signature/name mismatch: tests or graders that call singFarmSong() (as specified in the problem and present in the template) will not find that method in the solution Farm class. Additionally, the solution's Main still references farm.singFarmSong() (commented), creating an internal inconsistency within the solution repository.",

Also update the solution Main (if desired) to call farm.singFarmSong(). Alternatively, change the template and problem statement to use playFarmSong() everywhere, but keeping singFarmSong() (as in the problem/template) is the least disruptive option."
