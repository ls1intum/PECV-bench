      "description": "Template file src/de/tum/cit/ase/Farm.java is structurally invalid and does not match the problem statement or the solution. The template declares a class named AnimalFarm instead of Farm and contains a duplicated 'package' declaration and a nested/duplicated class declaration inside a method, producing malformed Java source that will not compile. This directly conflicts with the problem statement (which requires a class named Farm with specific methods/attributes) and with the solution (which provides a Farm class). As written, the template prevents students from compiling the project or implementing the intended Farm class and its methods (addAnimal, feedAllAnimals, singFarmSong, getters/setters), causing major confusion and blocking progress.",

Specifically: (1) Use the correct class name 'Farm' (public class Farm) in package de.tum.cit.ase; (2) remove the duplicated 'package' declaration and any nested/duplicated class declarations so the file is valid Java; (3) provide stubs (or minimal valid implementations) for the required members: private List<Animal> animals; a no-arg constructor initializing the ArrayList; getAnimals()/setAnimals(List<Animal>); addAnimal(Animal); feedAllAnimals(); singFarmSong(); and a private helper singFarmSongVerse(Animal). Keeping method bodies as TODOs is fine, but the class must be syntactically correct so students can compile and implement the exercise."

This mismatch breaks the direct mapping from the problem description to the starter code (students will look for a Farm class and may be confused or unable to find/implement the expected API), and also diverges from the solution implementation which uses the name Farm.",
