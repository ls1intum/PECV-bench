      "description": "The UML in the problem statement defines messageOnFeed() in Animal as a public abstract method (UML shows '+ messageOnFeed():String'), but the solution's Animal.java declares it as protected abstract String messageOnFeed(). This is a visibility mismatch: the problem/spec expects a public abstract method, while the solution uses protected. Students following the UML would implement a public abstract method; the solution's protected visibility is less permissive and therefore deviates from the specification, which can cause confusion about the intended visibility and API of the Animal class.",

Change the declaration in Animal.java to a public abstract method (public abstract String messageOnFeed();) so it matches the problem statement. Alternatively, if the intended design is to keep it protected, update the problem statement/UML to indicate a protected method. Prefer changing the solution to use 'public' to match the UML and the explicit problem requirements."
