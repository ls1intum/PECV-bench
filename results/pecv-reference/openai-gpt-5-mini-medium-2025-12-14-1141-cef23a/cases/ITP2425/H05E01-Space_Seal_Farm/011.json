      "description": "The problem statement / UML specifies the Animal attribute 'name' as type String (Animal - name: String), but the solution implementation declares the field as a StringBuilder (private StringBuilder name;) in Animal.java. Although the public getter/setter expose/accept String, the concrete attribute type in the solution differs from the specified type in the UML and problem description. This inconsistency could confuse students comparing their implementation to the reference solution or when the exercise explicitly asks to define the attribute as a String.",

Change the solution's Animal class field to 'private String name;' and update the constructor and setter to store the String directly (or update the problem statement/UML to allow StringBuilder if that was intentional). Keeping the public getter/setter signatures as String is fine, but the internal field type should match the specified 'String' to avoid confusion."
