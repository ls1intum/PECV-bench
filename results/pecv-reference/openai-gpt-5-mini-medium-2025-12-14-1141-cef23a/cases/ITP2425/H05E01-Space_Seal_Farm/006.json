      "description": "The problem statement and UML explicitly require Farm to use a List (implemented with ArrayList) for the animals attribute and to initialize an ArrayList in the no-arg constructor. The solution implementation instead uses a Set<Animal> (HashSet) for the animals attribute, with corresponding getter/setter returning/accepting a Set. This is a structural mismatch: the field type and constructor initialization in the solution do not match the required List/ArrayList in the specification. This can confuse students about which collection type to use, will produce different behavior (e.g., no guaranteed insertion order with HashSet vs. ordered behavior with ArrayList), and may cause tests or expected song output ordering to fail.",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the solution (and any template examples) conform to the problem specification by using a List<Animal> field and initializing it as an ArrayList in the no-argument constructor. Concretely: change the field type to 'private List<Animal> animals;', import java.util.List and java.util.ArrayList, initialize with 'this.animals = new ArrayList<>();', and update the getter/setter signatures to use List<Animal>. Alternatively, if the intention was to use a Set, update the problem statement and UML to explicitly require a Set and document the consequences (unordered collection) so students are not confused."
