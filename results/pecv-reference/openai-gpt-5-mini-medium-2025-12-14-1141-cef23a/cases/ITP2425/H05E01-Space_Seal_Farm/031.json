      "description": "The problem statement (UML and explicit note) requires the Animal constructor and the name getter/setter to have protected visibility (UML uses '#' and the text explicitly instructs to implement the name getter and setter with protected visibility). The reference solution implements these members as public (Animal.java: public Animal(String), public String getName(), public void setName(...)). This is a structural visibility mismatch: students following the problem text will implement protected accessors/constructor, while the solution exposes them as public. This discrepancy can confuse students about the intended encapsulation and grading expectations, and it diverges from the UML specification in the problem.",

Concretely, replace 'public Animal(String name)' with 'protected Animal(String name)', and replace the public getter/setter signatures with protected visibility. Alternatively, if public visibility was intended, update the problem statement/UML to indicate public visibility to avoid confusion."
