      "description": "The problem text explicitly requires the Farm to store \"unique animals without duplicates\" and to realize the aggregation using a Set implemented with a HashSet (Part 3 instructions). The solution implementation, however, declares the collection as a List<Animal> and initializes it as an ArrayList (solution_repository/src/de/tum/cit/ase/Farm.java). This is a structural mismatch: a List allows duplicates while a HashSet enforces uniqueness. Students following the problem text (or tests expecting uniqueness) would be confused by the solution using a List and could be led to an incorrect final design.",

Alternatively, if the intended design is a List, update the problem statement (Part 3) to remove the requirement to use a Set/HashSet and clarify expected behavior regarding duplicates."

This conflicting guidance (UML vs. textual requirement) is likely to confuse students about which collection type to implement.",
