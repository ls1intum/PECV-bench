      "description": "The problem statement is inconsistent about the type of the Animal.name attribute and this conflicts with the solution implementation. In the UML diagram the attribute is shown as name: String (problem_statement.md lines 26-29), but the textual instructions later explicitly require using StringBuilder for the name attribute to enable efficient modifications (problem_statement.md lines 84-86). The solution implementation (solution_repository/src/de/tum/cit/ase/Animal.java) declares the attribute as private String name with String-based getter/setter and constructor, not a StringBuilder. This ambiguity/conflict could confuse students about the expected type and the getter/setter signatures (should getName()/setName() work with String or StringBuilder?) and may lead to mismatched implementations or failing tests depending on what is enforced.",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the specification and the reference/template code consistent. Choose one of the following, and apply it across the problem statement, template, and solution:\n\n1) Prefer String (simpler): Remove the explicit request to use StringBuilder from the problem text and update any UML or textual notes to show name: String. Keep the template and solution using String. Also clarify that getName()/setName() operate on String.\n\n2) Prefer StringBuilder (as originally suggested in text): Update the UML to show name: StringBuilder and change the template and solution Animal class to store a StringBuilder (private StringBuilder name). Clearly specify whether getName() should return StringBuilder or String (recommended: keep getName() returning String by calling name.toString(), and provide a setter that accepts String or StringBuilder per the exercise intent). Update the template and tests accordingly so students can implement constructors/getters/setters consistently.\n\nAlso clarify in the problem statement what the getter/setter signatures should be (returning/accepting String or StringBuilder) so students are not left to guess."
