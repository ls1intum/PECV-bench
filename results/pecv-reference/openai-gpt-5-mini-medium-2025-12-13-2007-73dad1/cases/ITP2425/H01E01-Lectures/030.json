This name mismatch means the solution code will not compile (unresolved symbol errors) and is inconsistent with the UML / problem statement which uses camelCase names.

This creates a clear naming mismatch: the declared field names do not match the identifiers referenced elsewhere in the same class and do not match the names used in the problem UML. This will confuse students mapping the UML to the implementation and also introduces compilation/runtime errors in the solution code because references (e.g., this.lectureName) refer to non-existent fields.",

Alternatively, change all references (constructor, getters, setters, methods) to use the snake_case names, but aligning to the UML/camelCase is recommended to follow Java conventions and avoid student confusion.
