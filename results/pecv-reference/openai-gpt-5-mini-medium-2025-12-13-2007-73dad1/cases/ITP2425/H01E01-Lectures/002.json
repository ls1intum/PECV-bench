      "description": "The solution implementation declares the toString method with the wrong return type: it is annotated as @Override but defined as public Object toString() (solution repository). In Java the toString() method in java.lang.Object has signature public String toString(), so returning Object is not a valid override and the code will not compile. The problem statement asks students to implement a custom toString() (which by Java convention and the example in the instructions must return a String) and the template contains a TODO for adding a custom toString method. This mismatch between the solution and the expected toString signature is a structural error that would confuse students and break compilation of the provided solution reference.",

For example: @Override public String toString() { return \"Lecture{\" + ... + \"}\"; }. This makes the solution consistent with the problem statement and Java's Object.toString signature and ensures the solution compiles."
