    {
      "description": "The problem statement's UML incorrectly declares the attribute 'lectureName' as type int (problem_statement.md line 64). Elsewhere in the problem statement (toString example) and in the solution implementation 'lectureName' is treated as a String (e.g., example: \"Introduction to Programming\" and solution's Lecture.java declares private String lectureName). This is an inner cross-artifact type contradiction that will confuse students about the correct type to use for lectureName and will affect the constructor and getter/setter signatures they must implement.",
