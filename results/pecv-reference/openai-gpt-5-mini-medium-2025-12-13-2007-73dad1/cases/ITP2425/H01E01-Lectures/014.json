      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares numberOfInscribedStudents and numberOfGuestStudents as type double (problem_statement.md lines ~64-67), but the reference solution defines these attributes as int (solution_repository/src/de/tum/cit/ase/Lecture.java lines 6-10). This creates a type mismatch between the specification and the solution and is an inner-artifact contradiction: the UML uses double while methods (and the example method return types) imply integer usage. Students following the UML might implement these attributes as double, which will conflict with the intended solution and the expected method behaviors (e.g., getTotalNumberOfStudents returning int).",

Either (a) update the UML and problem statement to declare numberOfInscribedStudents and numberOfGuestStudents as int (recommended, to match the solution and methods returning int), or (b) if doubles were intended, change the solution to use double for these attributes and adjust getTotalNumberOfStudents (and any related methods) to return a double or explicitly cast to int where appropriate. Prefer aligning the problem statement UML to int to avoid student confusion."

The reference solution's constructor, however, takes ints for these parameters (solution_repository/src/de/tum/cit/ase/Lecture.java lines 13-19). This constructor-parameter type mismatch between problem specification and solution can mislead students about the correct parameter types and order to implement.",

The least disruptive fix is to change the UML to int to match the solution and typical usage in the exercise."
