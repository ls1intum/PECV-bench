      "description": "The problem statement text instructs students to implement the helper method singFarmSongVerse(Animal animal) as public, but the UML in the same problem statement shows singFarmSongVerse as private (minus sign). This is an internal contradiction in the specification and will confuse students about the intended visibility for the helper method.",

Either (A) update the textual instruction to match the UML and state that singFarmSongVerse should be private (recommended if it is intended as an internal helper), or (B) update the UML to show the method as public if the method must be public for testing. Make the problem statement consistent so students know the required visibility."

Two viable fixes: (1) If the helper is intended to be part of the public API for testing, change the method declarations in the template and solution to public (public void singFarmSongVerse(Animal animal)) and update method visibility in both files. Or (2) if the method is intended to be a private helper, update the problem text to remove the requirement that singFarmSongVerse be public and explicitly state it is a private helper (and update any test expectations accordingly)."
