      "description": "Return type mismatch for Farm.singFarmSong(): The problem statement (UML and explicit instructions) and the template define singFarmSong() as a void method that prints the song (side-effects to System.out). The solution, however, implements singFarmSong() as public String singFarmSong() that returns the entire song text instead of printing it. This contradicts the specified signature and behavior and may confuse students about whether the method should print or return the song; it can also break tests or the expected usage shown in Main (which expects a void method that prints).",

Alternatively, if returning the song text was intentional, update the problem statement and the template to document/expect a String-returning method and adapt Main and tests accordingly. Preferably, align the solution to the UML/instructions so students and tests are consistent."

The solution implements a private String singFarmSongVerse(Animal animal) that returns the verse text. This internal signature/behavior mismatch (returning text instead of printing) conflicts with the UML/template expectation and contributes to the higher-level singFarmSong() mismatch; it may confuse students inspecting the reference solution about whether the helper should print or return verse text.",
