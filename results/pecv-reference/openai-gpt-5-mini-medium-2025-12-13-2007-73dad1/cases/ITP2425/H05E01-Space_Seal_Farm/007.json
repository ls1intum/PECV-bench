      "description": "Visibility mismatch for Animal.messageOnFeed(): The UML in the problem statement declares messageOnFeed() as a public abstract method (+ messageOnFeed():String) but the solution implementation declares it as protected abstract (protected abstract String messageOnFeed()). This is a structural inconsistency: students reading the UML/spec will expect a public abstract method on Animal, while the reference code uses a protected abstract method. While the code still compiles (package access allows Farm to call it and subclasses can widen visibility), the mismatch can confuse students about the intended visibility and may cause tests or static checks that expect a public abstract method to fail.",

Change the declaration in src/de/tum/cit/ase/Animal.java to a public abstract method: 'public abstract String messageOnFeed();'. Alternatively, if the intended design is for the method to be protected, update the problem statement/UML to indicate protected visibility. Prefer changing the solution to 'public' to match the UML and students' expectations."
