      "description": "The problem statement explicitly instructs that Animal's name getter and setter should use protected visibility (and the UML shows the Animal constructor as protected), but the solution implementation declares the constructor and both accessor methods as public. This is a structural visibility mismatch between the specification (problem/UML) and the provided solution. Students reading the problem will be told to implement protected accessors/constructor, but the reference solution uses public methods \u2014 causing confusion about the intended visibility and potentially causing mismatches with any automated checks that expect protected visibility.",

Alternatively, if public accessors/constructor were intended, update the problem statement/UML to specify public visibility so all artifacts agree."
