      "description": "The problem statement explicitly requires the Farm to maintain its animals as a List implemented using an ArrayList, initialized in a no-argument constructor. The solution implementation instead declares the animals field as a Queue<Animal> backed by a LinkedList (LinkedList/Queue). This is a structural type mismatch for the core Farm attribute and its getter/setter signatures and contradicts the explicit instruction in the problem. Students following the specification will implement List/ArrayList, but the reference solution uses a different collection type which can cause confusion and may break automated checks that expect a List API or ArrayList usage.",

      "suggested_fix": "Align the solution with the problem specification by changing the Farm implementation to use a List<Animal> backed by an ArrayList. For example: declare 'private List<Animal> animals;', initialize it in the no-arg constructor with 'this.animals = new ArrayList<>();', and update the getter/setter signatures to use List<Animal>. Alternatively, if using Queue/LinkedList in the solution was intentional, update the problem statement to accept any Collection type (and remove the explicit 'ArrayList' requirement) to avoid confusing students."
