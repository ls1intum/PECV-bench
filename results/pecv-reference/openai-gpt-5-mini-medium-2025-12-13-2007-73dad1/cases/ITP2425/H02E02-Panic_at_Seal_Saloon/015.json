      "description": "The problem statement's UML and textual description specify orderMeal(Meal) with a void return type, but the solution implementation declares orderMeal(Meal) as returning boolean. This is a signature mismatch that could confuse students about the expected method contract (whether they should implement a void method or one that returns a boolean) and may cause discrepancies with any tests or grading expectations that rely on the void signature.",

Either update the solution to match the problem statement by changing the solution's method to 'public void orderMeal(Meal meal)' (remove the boolean return and adjust return statements accordingly), or update the problem statement/UML to declare 'orderMeal(Meal): boolean' and document the meaning of the boolean return. Preferably change the solution to void to match the existing UML/specification."
