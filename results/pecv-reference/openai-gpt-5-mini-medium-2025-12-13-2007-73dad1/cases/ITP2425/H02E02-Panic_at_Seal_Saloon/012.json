      "description": "The problem statement and UML refer to a class named Stock (and show its methods), but the template repository provides an Inventory class that implements those methods while Stock.java is an empty file. The solution also uses Inventory as the type of the shared stock attribute (private static final Inventory stock). This class-name/type mismatch (Stock vs Inventory) is a structural inconsistency that will confuse students: the specification expects them to work with or modify Stock, yet the functional implementation is in Inventory and Stock.java is empty. Students may waste time searching for/implementing Stock methods that already exist under Inventory or be unsure which class they should extend/modify.",

Also remove or populate the empty Stock.java to avoid confusion. This keeps the structural API aligned with the exercise description and prevents students from being blocked by a class-name mismatch."

This naming divergence breaks the direct mapping from the exercise text/UML to the codebase: students reading the problem will look for a Stock class and its methods, but the functioning implementation is provided under the name Inventory, causing confusion and wasted time locating the correct class.",
