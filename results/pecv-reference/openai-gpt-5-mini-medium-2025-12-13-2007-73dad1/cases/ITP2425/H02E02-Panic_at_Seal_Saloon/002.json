      "description": "Conflicting instructions about the SealSaloon.stock field: the problem text tells students to initialize both attributes (orders and stock) in the SealSaloon constructor (problem_statement.md, lines ~70\u201371), but it also requires that the stock attribute be static (shared across all instances) (problem_statement.md, lines ~77\u201381). In Java a static final field must be initialized at declaration or in a static initializer, not in an instance constructor. This mismatch can confuse students and lead to compile-time errors if they try to follow both instructions literally. The reference solution resolves this by declaring and initializing stock as a static final field at declaration (SealSaloon.java, lines 5\u20136), which contradicts the earlier instruction to initialize it in the constructor.",

Prefer (A) to match the intended shared-stock design and the provided solution: update the problem statement to say explicitly that \"stock is static (shared) and should be initialized at declaration (or in a static initializer), while orders should be initialized in the constructor.\" Also update the UML/diagrams (if shown) to indicate that stock is static if desired."
