      "description": "The template repository contains an Order class and an empty Meal.java, while the problem statement and the solution refer to a fully implemented Meal class. This creates a structural mismatch: students expect a ready-to-use Meal type (the problem explicitly lists 'Meal (Fully implemented)') but the template does not provide it and instead provides a different class name (Order). This will confuse students about which class to use and may lead them to implement or rename classes incorrectly. The Main examples in the template also reference Order in comments whereas the solution and problem use Meal.",

This mismatch (Meal vs Order) is likely to confuse students: the problem says a Meal class is available/expected, but the starter code forces them to either (a) notice and rename Order to Meal or (b) implement a new Meal class alongside Order. The conceptual entity (a meal definition carrying a name and ingredient list) is the same, but identifiers differ across artifacts, creating a mapping barrier.",
