In the solution, calculateRemainingOrderNumber() is implemented as public void calculateRemainingOrderNumber() and only prints lines instead of returning an int. This is a signature/return-type mismatch that will confuse students about the expected API and can cause tests or student implementations to disagree on the method contract.",

Either (A) change the solution implementation to have signature public int calculateRemainingOrderNumber() that returns the number of remaining orders (e.g., return this.orders.length) and, if needed, optionally print the numbering as a separate concern; or (B) if the intended behavior is to print order numbers and not return a value, update the problem statement and UML to declare the method as void and show the printing behavior unambiguously. Prefer option (A) to preserve the stated requirement that the method returns an int."

If the method is supposed to return the remaining order count, remove or reword the printed example and show a code/example that exercises the return value. If the method should print the order numbers (and not return a value), change the textual requirement and the UML signature to void. Make the expected behavior explicit (return-only, print-only, or return-and-print) so students implement the correct signature and behavior."
