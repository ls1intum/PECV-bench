      "description": "Conflicting instructions about the SealSaloon.stock field: the problem text instructs students to make the stock a final Stock and to initialize it in the constructor (instance initialization), but it also states that the stock attribute must be static (shared across instances). In Java a static final field cannot be assigned in an instance constructor (static finals must be initialized at declaration or in a static initializer). This makes the combination of requirements impossible to satisfy and will confuse students about how to declare and initialize the field.",

Update the problem text to explicitly state the chosen option and show the correct initialization approach (e.g., \"private static final Stock stock = new Stock();\" or \"private final Stock stock; this.stock = new Stock();\" in the constructor). This removes the impossible requirement of assigning a static final field inside an instance constructor."

This naming mismatch means students reading the task and the example code expect acceptSupplyDelivery to exist, while the reference solution implements the same functionality under a different identifier. This creates confusion mapping the requirement to the implementation and will cause compile/runtime mismatch if students copy the example call or expect the specific method name from the problem.",
