      "description": "The problem statement's UML specifies StockIngredient.price as an int and a constructor StockIngredient(String, int, int), but the template repository's StockIngredient uses a double price (constructor param and getPrice() return type). The solution repository uses int for price. This mismatch can confuse students when they implement SealSaloon.calculateTotalPrice (the problem requires calculateTotalPrice to return int and sum ingredient prices) because adding a double price to an int accumulator will cause type issues/compilation errors or require casts. It also contradicts the constructor signature shown in the UML (int vs double), which may lead students to question which type to use.",

Recommended fix: change the template repository's StockIngredient.price, constructor parameter, and getPrice() return type from double to int so they match the UML in the problem statement and the solution implementation. Alternatively, if the intention was to use double prices, update the UML and the solution to use double consistently and adjust the calculateTotalPrice return type/implementation accordingly."
