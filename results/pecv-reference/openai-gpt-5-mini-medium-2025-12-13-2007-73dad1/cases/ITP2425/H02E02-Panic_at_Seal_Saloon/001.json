Alternatively, if integer prices are intentional, update the problem statement and UML to state an int return type and remove the note about double precision."

      "description": "The problem text instructs that both attributes (orders and a final Stock stock) \"should be initialized to default values ... in the constructor of SealSaloon\" (constructor takes no parameters). However, the problem also mandates that the stock attribute must be static (and final). Initializing a static final field in an instance constructor is not appropriate/possible in the normal Java pattern and is contradictory. The solution declares the stock as private static final and initializes it at the point of declaration. This is a contradiction within the problem statement about where/how the stock should be initialized and may confuse students about how to declare/initialize a static final field.",

If stock must be static (shared across instances), instruct students to declare and initialize the static stock either at the field declaration or in a static initializer, and reserve the constructor for instance-specific initialization (e.g., orders). For example: \"Declare a private static final Stock stock and initialize it at declaration (or in a static block). Initialize the instance field orders in the no-argument constructor.\" This removes the contradictory requirement to initialize a static/final field in an instance constructor."
