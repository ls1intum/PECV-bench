      "description": "The problem statement (UML and textual description) specifies checkOrderReady() as a void method, but the solution implementation declares checkOrderReady() to return a boolean. This is a signature mismatch: students reading the specification will implement a void method (and the problem text instructs to call it without using a return value), while the reference solution exposes a return value. This discrepancy can confuse students about the intended API and method contract.",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the method signature consistent. Either change the solution to declare checkOrderReady() as void (removing the boolean return) to match the problem statement and UML, or update the problem statement/UML to document that checkOrderReady() returns a boolean (and explain the meaning of the return value). Preferably, keep it void in both places since the textual description treats it as a procedure called for its side effects."

      "description": "The problem statement instructs that both orders and the stock should be \"initialized to default values ... in the constructor of SealSaloon\" (constructor takes no parameters), but later explicitly requires the stock attribute to be static (shared across instances). This is inconsistent: initializing a static shared stock in an instance constructor is confusing and contrary to the static requirement. The solution declares the stock as a static final field and initializes it at the field declaration rather than in the instance constructor. Students may be confused about where and how to initialize a static shared field when the instructions say to initialize it in the constructor.",

Align the textual instructions with the static requirement so students are not confused about where to initialize the shared stock."
