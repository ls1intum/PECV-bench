This is a modifier/signature mismatch that could confuse students about whether calculateTotalPrice should be static and how to access the shared stock inside it.",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the method modifier consistent with the specification. Either (A) change the solution to declare calculateTotalPrice as static: public static int calculateTotalPrice(Meal meal) and use the static stock inside it, or (B) update the problem statement to remove the requirement that calculateTotalPrice must be static. Recommended: implement the method as public static int calculateTotalPrice(Meal meal) so it aligns with the explicit static requirement for shared stock and the acceptSupplyDelivery method."
