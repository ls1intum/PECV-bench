      "description": "Method name mismatch between the problem statement and the code: the problem text and UML refer to a static method named calculateTotalPrice(Meal) (used in multiple places), but both the template's commented Main and the solution implement and call a method named computeMealCost(Meal). This is a structural inconsistency in the expected API (name/signature) and can confuse students about which method to implement and which name the tests expect.",

Initializing a static shared field in an instance constructor is misleading and contradicts the later explicit requirement that stock be static and shared. This creates confusion about whether stock is an instance or class-level attribute and where students should initialize it.",
