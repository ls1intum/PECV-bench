      "description": "The problem UML and the solution expect a Stock method named addToStockIngredients(StockIngredient) (see UML lines and solution Stock implementation). However, the template Stock class provides a method named addItem(StockIngredient) instead. This name mismatch is structural: a student following the UML (or the solution) and calling stock.addToStockIngredients(...) from their SealSaloon implementation will get a compile error because the template's Stock does not declare that method. Conversely, if they use addItem as provided in the template, their code would disagree with the UML/specification and with the reference solution. This inconsistency can block students or cause confusion about the correct API to use.",

Alternatively, update the problem statement/UML to refer to addItem instead of addToStockIngredients \u2014 but keeping the template consistent with the UML/solution is recommended to avoid student confusion."

      "description": "The Problem Statement UML and the Solution implementation use the method name addToStockIngredients(StockIngredient) on the Stock class, but the Template repository implements this operation as addItem(StockIngredient). This name divergence means students reading the UML or the problem text will look for addToStockIngredients, while the starter code offers addItem (and the solution calls addToStockIngredients). This creates a direct mapping and compilation confusion when students implement SealSaloon.acceptSupplyDelivery or follow the UML: they may call a method that does not exist in the template or fail to find the intended method in the starter code.",
