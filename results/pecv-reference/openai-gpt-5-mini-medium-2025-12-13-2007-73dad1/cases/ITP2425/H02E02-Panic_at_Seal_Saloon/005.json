This mismatch between the documented type (List) and the code (arrays) can confuse students about which collection type to implement and which helper methods to use.",

Either (a) change the problem text to request an array-based orders attribute (e.g., Meal[] orders) and mention/encourage using ArrayHelpers, or (b) update the template and solution to use a modifiable List<Meal> (e.g., ArrayList) and provide corresponding helper code. Prefer the first option if you intend students to work with the existing ArrayHelpers and Stock implementations."

      "description": "The problem statement tells students to initialize both attributes (orders and stock) in the SealSaloon constructor, but elsewhere it requires the stock attribute to be static and final (shared across instances). Initializing a static final field in an instance constructor is misleading and can cause students to attempt an invalid implementation. The solution initializes the static final stock at declaration instead. This is a contradiction in where/how stock should be initialized.",

Alternatively, remove the requirement that stock be static if you want students to initialize it in the constructor \u2014 but be explicit to avoid confusion."
