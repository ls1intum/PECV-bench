      "description": "The problem statement explicitly requires the implementation of a method named `checkOrderReady()` to handle the processing of meal orders from the queue. However, the solution repository implements the described logic within a method named `processOrders()`. This naming mismatch creates a direct mapping confusion for students, as they are instructed to implement a method with one name (`checkOrderReady()`) but the functionality is provided under a different name (`processOrders()`) in the solution, hindering their ability to connect the requirements to the code.",
