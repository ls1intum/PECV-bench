      "description": "The solution repository's PersonScene class introduces a direct dependency on PersonService (import and a final personService field) and comments that this is an \"MVC VIOLATION.\" This contradicts the problem statement's MVC design (View should interact with Controller, not Service) and the template PersonScene which only uses PersonController. Additionally, the solution declares personService as a final field but does not initialize it in the constructor, which would cause a compilation error. This divergence both violates the intended architecture the exercise is teaching and creates a build/run blocker or confusion when students inspect the solution.",

The PersonScene should only interact with PersonController (as in the template and the MVC specification). If server/service functionality is needed, move that functionality into PersonController or initialize any required dependencies via the controller and constructor so the view never directly depends on the service. Also ensure no final fields are left uninitialized to avoid compilation errors."

The template and solution code use Consumer<List<Person>> for PersonController methods. This mismatch (Note vs Person) is an unintended identifier naming inconsistency that can confuse students: the textual specification refers to Notes in the context of PersonController, while the provided code and UML treat Persons. Students may be unsure whether to implement methods for Note or Person callbacks and may waste time reconciling the mismatch.",
