      "description": "HTTP verb for creating a Person is inconsistent between the problem statement and the provided solution (and client). The problem statement explicitly lists POST /persons as the endpoint to create a new person (Problem statement lines 109-113). However, the solution implements creation with a PUT mapping on /persons (Server: PersonResource uses @PutMapping(\"persons\"); Solution client: PersonController.addPerson() sends a PUT request). This mismatch will confuse students: they will implement a POST endpoint (and a client sending POST) as described in the task, but the provided solution uses PUT, making direct comparisons, tests or provided reference behavior inconsistent. The template's PersonResource currently contains a TODO (no endpoints) so it does not resolve the ambiguity for students.",
