The problem statement explicitly defines the person endpoints as POST /persons, GET /persons, PUT /persons/{personId}, DELETE /persons/{personId} (problem_statement.md).

This cross-artifact naming difference (\"persons\" vs \"people\") is structural and will confuse students implementing the client or server and trying to follow the specification.",
