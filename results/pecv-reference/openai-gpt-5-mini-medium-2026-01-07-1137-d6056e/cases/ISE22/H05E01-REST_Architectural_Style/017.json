      "description": "Return type and implementation of PersonService.getAllPersons is inconsistent across artifacts. The problem statement and template define/getAllPersons as returning a List<Person> (the REST endpoint should return a list), and the PersonResource (solution) expects a List<Person> to be returned from the service. In the solution repository, PersonService.getAllPersons changes the method signature to return Stream<Person> and contains an invalid implementation using undefined variables (sortedList) and Stream operations in a way that does not produce a List. This mismatch will prevent the server endpoints and students' implementations from compiling and running as intended and conflicts with the exercise description that the GET /persons returns a list of persons.",

Concretely: keep the method signature public List<Person> getAllPersons(PersonSortingOptions sortingOptions), perform sorting by choosing a Comparator based on sortingOptions (compare by id, firstName, lastName or birthday and reverse when DESCENDING), create a new List (or unmodifiable List) with the sorted elements, and return that List. Ensure variable names are consistent (e.g. use sortedList) and remove incorrect Stream/undefined-variable usage so PersonResource and the REST endpoint receive a List<Person> as specified."
