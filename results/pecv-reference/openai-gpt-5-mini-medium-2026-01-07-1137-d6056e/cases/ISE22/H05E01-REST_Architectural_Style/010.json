      "description": "Endpoint path mismatch between the problem statement (and the client-side template/solution) and the server-side solution. The problem statement and client expect the persons endpoints at /persons (POST /persons, GET /persons, PUT /persons/{id}, DELETE /persons/{id}). The solution's PersonResource, however, exposes GET at /v2/persons and PUT at /v2/persons/{personId} while POST and DELETE remain at /persons. This inconsistent versioning of the path means the client (which calls /persons) will not reach the server for GET and PUT requests, preventing the intended functionality and causing confusing runtime failures for students.",
