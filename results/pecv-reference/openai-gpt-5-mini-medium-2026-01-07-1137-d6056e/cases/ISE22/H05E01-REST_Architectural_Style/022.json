      "description": "Class-level @RequestMapping media types for PersonResource differ between the template and the solution. The template declares consumes/produces = JSON-only, while the solution expands these to include both JSON and XML. This is a cross-artifact difference in the expected request/response media types for the same REST resource and could confuse students when they compare the template to the reference: they may wonder whether XML support is required or expected, or why the solution accepts additional media types.",

Either (a) update the template PersonResource class-level @RequestMapping to produce/consume the same media types as the solution (include both JSON and XML), or (b) keep JSON-only in the solution as well. Alternatively, remove the class-level consumes/produces and annotate individual endpoints if needed. Document the intended media types in the problem statement so students know whether XML support is expected."

However, the provided Starter class immediately launches H05E01ClientApplication. This contradictory guidance (do not run a class that Starter launches) may confuse students about the correct way to start the client and the reason for the prohibition.",
