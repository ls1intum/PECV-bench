      "description": "The problem statement explicitly says the `parents` attribute is a List that preserves insertion order, but both the template and the solution define `parents` as a Set (HashSet) in Person.java. This is a structural mismatch: students reading the problem will expect a List API and semantics (preserved insertion order, allowing duplicates in principle), but the provided code and reference solution use Set semantics (no duplicates, no guaranteed insertion order). This can confuse students about which collection type to use, which methods are available, and how to satisfy the requirement to \"preserve insertion order\".",

Two options:\n\n1) If the intent is to preserve insertion order for parents, change the template and solution Person.java to use a List (e.g., private List<Person> parents = new ArrayList<>();) and annotate the ManyToMany mapping to preserve order (e.g., add @OrderColumn or @OrderBy) so JPA will persist ordering. Update any tests that expect Set semantics accordingly.\n\n2) If the intended implementation is the one shown in the template/solution (using Set semantics), update the problem statement to remove the claim that `parents` is a List and do not promise insertion order. Preferably phrase it as \"parents is a collection (Set) of Person\" or simply \"parents is a collection of Person\" to match the code and tests.\n\nPrefer updating the problem statement to match the current template/solution if the provided reference solution and tests rely on Set semantics; otherwise update the code to List+@OrderColumn and adapt tests."

      "description": "The problem statement explicitly states that the 'parents' attribute is a List that preserves insertion order, but both the template and the solution model declare 'parents' (and 'children') as Set<Person> backed by HashSet. This is a semantic mismatch about the representation of the same conceptual attribute: 'parents'. Students reading the problem will expect a List-based API/behavior (ordered, possibly indexed), while the provided code and reference solution use Set semantics (no guaranteed insertion order, uniqueness). This discrepancy can create confusion about the expected data structure, how to implement/add parents, and what behavior (ordering/duplicates) is required.",
