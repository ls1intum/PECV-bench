      "description": "The problem statement requires a public constructor for each class that takes all attributes defined in the UML (Ride must have a public constructor Ride(String name, char abbreviation) \u2014 see instructions). In the provided solution, Ride.java does not declare any constructor, but its concrete subclasses (RollerCoaster, LaunchedDropdownTower, LaunchedRollerCoaster) call super(name, abbreviation). This is a structural contradiction: the solution omits the required Ride constructor while other classes rely on it, which would prevent the intended inheritance-based construction and confuse students comparing the specification and the reference solution.",

Concretely, declare in Ride.java:\n\npublic Ride(String name, char abbreviation) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.abbreviation = abbreviation;\n}\n\nThis aligns the solution with the problem statement and allows subclasses to correctly call super(name, abbreviation). Ensure the constructor is public (as required by the exercise) and that template files are updated similarly so students have a consistent starting point."
