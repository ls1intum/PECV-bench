However, the solution implementation declares 'rides' as a public field (public List<Ride> rides). This is a visibility mismatch: students expecting to follow the task (and unit tests that check for private attributes) could be confused by the public field in the solution, and the public field deviates from the specified encapsulation requirement.",
