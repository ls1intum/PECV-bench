      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares Ride's attributes as protected (#name: String and #abbreviation: char), but the solution implementation declares these attributes as private. This is a visibility mismatch between the specification (UML) and the reference solution. Students reading the UML will likely implement protected attributes, while the solution (and possibly tests) uses private. This inconsistency can confuse students about the intended visibility and may cause automated checks that verify attribute visibility to fail or behave unexpectedly.",

Either change the Ride attributes in the solution (and template) to protected (e.g. 'protected String name; protected char abbreviation;') so they match the UML, or update the UML/problem statement to mark these attributes as private if private visibility was intended. Also ensure the template files reflect the same visibility so students are not confused when filling in the missing code."
