      "description": "The problem statement explicitly requires that LaunchedRollerCoaster's constructor must only accept (name, abbreviation) as parameters (problem_statement.md, task 6). The solution implementation for LaunchedRollerCoaster provides a constructor that accepts (name, abbreviation, numberOfLoopings) and forwards that to RollerCoaster's constructor. This conflicts with the task requirement and will confuse students and automated tests that check for the two-parameter constructor. It also creates an implementation barrier because the superclass RollerCoaster currently requires numberOfLoopings, yet the exercise explicitly instructs LaunchedRollerCoaster to expose only name and abbreviation as its constructor parameters.",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the solution match the problem requirement. Provide a LaunchedRollerCoaster constructor that only accepts (String name, char abbreviation). Two ways to fix: (1) Change the existing constructor to public LaunchedRollerCoaster(String name, char abbreviation) and call super(name, abbreviation, 0) (or another sensible default) so the superclass gets a numberOfLoopings value; or (2) add an overload: public LaunchedRollerCoaster(String name, char abbreviation) { this(name, abbreviation, 0); } keeping the existing three-arg constructor if desired. Ensure the class signature and constructor visibility remain public. This preserves the educational intent (students implement the two-arg constructor) while resolving the mismatch with RollerCoaster's constructor."
