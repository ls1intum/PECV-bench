      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares Animal.messageOnFeed() as public (UML shows a '+' sign), but the solution's Animal class declares the method as protected (protected abstract String messageOnFeed()). This is a visibility mismatch between the specification (problem/UML) and the provided solution. Students reading the UML will expect to declare the abstract method as public; seeing a protected declaration in the reference solution (or if the template were to provide a signature) can cause confusion about the intended visibility.",

Either update the solution code to declare the abstract method as public (public abstract String messageOnFeed();) to match the UML/specification, or explicitly modify the problem statement/UML to show a protected visibility (e.g., '#' or note) if protected was intended. The simpler fix preserving the UML intent is to change Animal.messageOnFeed() to public abstract String messageOnFeed()."
