      "description": "Constructor signature for Animal is inconsistent between the problem statement UML and the provided/template code. The UML and problem text specify an Animal constructor taking two parameters (Animal(String, int)) and an age attribute, while the template's usage (Main.java) and the solution implement Animal with a single-parameter constructor (Animal(String)) and no age parameter. If students follow the problem statement strictly (two-arg constructor) they will be unable to use the template Main or match the provided solution, and may be blocked from compiling or running the starter code.",

However the reference solution's Animal class only defines the name attribute and a single-argument constructor Animal(String) (no age field). The template's Main (example usage) further shows single-argument constructions (e.g., Seal(\"Clarabelle\")), adding ambiguity about which constructor students should implement. This mismatch around the attribute 'age' and the constructor signature creates confusion: students following the UML will implement/initialize an age field and expect a two-argument constructor, while the provided solution and example usage use a one-argument constructor. That inconsistency increases extraneous cognitive load and may cause students to implement constructors/fields that don't match the solution or the provided examples.",
