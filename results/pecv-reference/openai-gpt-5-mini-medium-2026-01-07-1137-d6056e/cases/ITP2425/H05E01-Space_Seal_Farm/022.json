      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares singFarmSongVerse(animal: Animal) as private (shown as '-' in the UML), and the template repository defines singFarmSongVerse as a private method stub (Farm.java). The solution implementation, however, declares singFarmSongVerse as protected (solution_repository/src/de/tum/cit/ase/Farm.java:33). This is a visibility mismatch between the problem specification/template and the reference solution. While this does not prevent implementing the core functionality, it is a structural inconsistency that may confuse students about the intended visibility and could affect tests or subclassing expectations.",

Either change the solution's singFarmSongVerse to private to match the UML and template, or update the problem statement (UML) and template to document/provide a protected singFarmSongVerse if tests or intended design require subclass access. Prefer making the method private in the solution (or documenting protected visibility) so all three artifacts agree."
