      "description": "Method name mismatch for the farm-song method: the problem statement and UML refer to a method named printFarmSong(), but the template repository and the provided solution both declare and use singFarmSong() (and singFarmSongVerse(...)). This naming discrepancy can confuse students (the instructions ask them to implement printFarmSong(), but the starter code exposes singFarmSong()), causing them to implement the wrong method name or search for a non-existent method in the template.",

Ensure the task text and code use the same method name so students know which method to implement."

This is the same conceptual operation (print/play the Old MacDonald song for all animals) but with two different public method names. A student following the textual instruction will look for printFarmSong() in the template and tests; the provided template/solution use singFarmSong(), which creates a direct mapping confusion between the requirement and the starter/solution code.",
