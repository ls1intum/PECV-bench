      "description": "The UML and textual instructions specify that Farm has a private attribute 'animals: List<Animal>' and explicitly ask students to implement a getter and setter. In the solution implementation, the animals field is declared public (public List<Animal> animals;). This visibility mismatch undermines the intended encapsulation and contradicts the problem specification (which shows the attribute as private and instructs to provide getter/setter). Students comparing their implementation to the solution or to tests may be confused about whether the field should be private and whether they must use accessors.",
