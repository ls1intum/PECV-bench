    {
      "description": "Visibility mismatch for Animal's constructor and name accessors: the problem statement (UML and explicit note) indicates the Animal constructor and the getName()/setName() methods should have protected visibility (UML uses '#', and Part 1 explicitly asks for protected getter/setter). The solution implementation declares the constructor and both accessor methods as public. This deviates from the specified encapsulation and may confuse students about the intended visibility (and cause tests that check for protected visibility to fail).",
