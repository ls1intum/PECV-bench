      "description": "Constructor / attribute mismatch: The problem statement (UML) defines Animal with a single attribute name:String and student code (template Main) expects single-argument constructors for Seal, Pig, Goat (e.g., new Seal(\"Clarabelle\")). The solution repository, however, adds an extra attribute age to Animal and implements constructors that require (String name, int age) for Animal and all concrete animals. This creates a structural conflict: the constructor signatures in the solution do not match the constructors implied by the UML and the template's example usage, and the solution introduces an attribute (age) that is not specified in the problem statement. Students following the specification or using the provided Main snippet will be unable to instantiate the provided classes without modification.",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the constructor signatures and attributes consistent across all artifacts. Two reasonable fixes:\n\n1) Align everything to the problem statement and template: remove the extra age attribute from Animal and change the concrete animal constructors in the solution to accept only (String name). Ensure Animal has a constructor Animal(String name) and subclasses call super(name).\n\n2) If age is desired as part of the exercise, update the problem statement (UML and textual description) and the template Main example to include the age parameter (e.g., new Seal(\"Clarabelle\", 3)) and document the additional attribute. Update the UML to show Animal has name:String and age:int and require constructors accordingly.\n\nEither approach resolves the inconsistency; prefer the first if the intent is to follow the provided UML and template Main snippet."
