      "description": "The problem statement contains conflicting information about the collection type used to store animals in Farm: the UML diagram shows animals: List<Animal>, whereas the textual instructions (Part 3) explicitly require a Set implemented using HashSet. The provided solution implements Farm using a List (ArrayList), and the template Farm.java does not yet declare the collection (left as a TODO). This discrepancy creates confusion for students about which collection to implement (List vs Set) and which behavior to guarantee (allow duplicates vs enforce uniqueness).",

Option A (preferable if uniqueness is intended): update the UML and solution/template to use Set<Animal> and initialize it as a HashSet in the Farm no-arg constructor; keep/add getter/setter for Set<Animal> and ensure addAnimal enforces uniqueness. Option B (if duplicates are acceptable): update the textual instructions in the problem statement (Part 3) to require a List (e.g., ArrayList) and remove the explicit HashSet requirement. Apply the chosen change to the UML diagram, the textual instructions, the template Farm.java (add the field and imports consistent with the choice), and the solution so all three artifacts match."

      "description": "The problem text requires Farm to store unique animals using a Set (HashSet) and to initialize the HashSet in the no-arg constructor, but the reference solution implements the collection as a List (ArrayList). The template Farm.java also does not provide the animals field yet. This is a cross-artifact mismatch in the conceptual representation of the Farm->animals aggregation: students are instructed to use a Set (for uniqueness) but the solution uses a List (which allows duplicates). This discrepancy can confuse students about the required data structure and whether uniqueness is a requirement, and it may lead them to implement a Set while the provided solution uses a different type and behavior.",
