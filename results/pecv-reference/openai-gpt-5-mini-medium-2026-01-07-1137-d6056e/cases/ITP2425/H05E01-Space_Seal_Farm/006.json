      "description": "The problem statement requires the Farm to use a List (specifically an ArrayList) to store animals and instructs students to initialize an ArrayList in the no-arg constructor. The solution implementation, however, uses a Set<Animal> (HashSet) for the animals attribute and returns/accepts Set<Animal> in its getter/setter. This is a structural mismatch: students following the problem text/template will implement List<Animal> and ArrayList, but the reference solution (and any tests derived from it) uses Set, which can cause confusion and test incompatibility.",

      "suggested_fix": "Align the solution with the problem statement (preferred): change the solution's Farm.animals type to List<Animal>, initialize it as new ArrayList<>(), and update the getter/setter signatures to use List<Animal>. Alternatively, if Set semantics were intended, update the problem statement and template to explicitly allow/require a Set (and explain why). The first option (using List/ArrayList) preserves the exercise's stated learning goal about aggregation using ArrayList."
