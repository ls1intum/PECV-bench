      "description": "Return type of Milkable.messageOnMilk() is inconsistent between the problem specification/UML and the solution. The problem statement and UML explicitly define messageOnMilk() as returning a boolean (the text: \"The method messageOnMilk() should return true if milking was successful, false otherwise\" and the UML shows messageOnMilk():boolean). In the solution repository the Milkable interface declares messageOnMilk() returning String and the implementing classes (Goat, Seal) return String messages (e.g. \"Goat <name> is milked\"). This mismatch changes the required interface contract and would confuse students about whether to implement messageOnMilk() to return a boolean or a String, and would break any tests or starter code that expect a boolean result.",

Preferred fixes (choose one to align artifacts):\n\n1) Align solution to the specification (recommended given the UML and textual description):\n   - Change Milkable.java to declare messageOnMilk() returning boolean:\n       public interface Milkable { boolean messageOnMilk(); }\n   - Update Goat and Seal to implement messageOnMilk() with a boolean return (e.g. return true when milking is successful). If you still want to provide textual feedback, add a separate method (e.g. getMilkMessage()) or print messages where appropriate.\n   - Ensure any tests or Main usage that expect boolean values (e.g. System.out.println(m.messageOnMilk())) continue to work.\n\n2) Alternatively, if the intended design is to return textual messages, update the problem statement and UML to indicate messageOnMilk():String and change the descriptive text to match the String contract. Update any instructions that say the method should return true/false.\n\nApply the chosen change consistently in the template, problem statement/UML, and solution so students are not confused about the required return type."

This mismatch (boolean vs String) refers to the same conceptual operation (milking an animal) but uses different return types/names across artifacts. Students following the problem description will expect a boolean-returning method and may implement or test for boolean values, while the solution (and its types/signatures) expect String values \u2014 causing compilation/test mismatches and significant confusion when mapping requirements to code.",

Keep the solution as-is.\n\n2) Prefer boolean return as currently written in the problem: change the solution repository's Milkable interface to 'boolean messageOnMilk();' and update Seal and Goat implementations to return true/false (and, if desired, move any status messages to separate methods or to print statements). Also update any tests or example code accordingly.\n\nApply the chosen fix to the problem statement UML and textual description, the template (add the Milkable interface with the chosen signature), and the solution so all artifacts use the same signature and semantics."
