      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares getTotalNumberOfStudents() as returning String (+getTotalNumberOfStudents(): String) while the solution implementation provides getTotalNumberOfStudents() with return type int. The textual task description asks students to \"check the expected return type in the UML diagram,\" which would lead students to implement a String return type if they follow the UML. This mismatch between the problem statement (UML) and the solution (and the likely intended numeric meaning of \"total number of students\") can confuse students and cause failing implementations or tests.",

      "suggested_fix": "Align the return type across artifacts. The most straightforward fix is to update the UML in problem_statement.md to declare getTotalNumberOfStudents(): int (replace String with int) and update any explanatory text that points students to the UML. Alternatively, if a String return type was intentional, change the solution and tests to return a String (e.g., Integer.toString(total)) and document that choice. Prefer changing the UML to int, since a numeric total is naturally represented as an int."
