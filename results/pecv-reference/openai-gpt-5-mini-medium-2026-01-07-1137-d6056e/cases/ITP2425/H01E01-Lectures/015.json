      "description": "The constructor parameter order in the solution does not follow the attribute order shown in the UML diagram in the problem statement. The problem explicitly instructs students to follow the UML order when implementing the constructor, but the solution's constructor signature places lectureName first and numberOfInscribedStudents second, while the UML lists numberOfInscribedStudents first and lectureName second. This mismatch can confuse students about the expected constructor parameter order and may cause test failures if automated checks expect the UML order.",

Ensure the template's constructor TODO and any tests align with the chosen order."
