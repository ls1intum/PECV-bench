      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares numberOfInscribedStudents and numberOfGuestStudents as double (problem_statement.md: lines 64-68), but the solution implementation uses int for these attributes (solution_repository/src/de/tum/cit/ase/Lecture.java: lines 6-10). Additionally, the UML specifies getTotalNumberOfStudents(): int (problem_statement.md: line 70) which is internally inconsistent with declaring the student counts as double in the UML (summing doubles but returning an int). This mismatch between the problem specification and the reference solution (and the inner-artifact contradiction in the UML itself) can confuse students about the correct data types to implement and whether casting is required when computing totals.",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the types consistent across the UML, template, and solution. Two reasonable fixes:\n1) If integers are intended: update the UML in problem_statement.md to declare numberOfInscribedStudents and numberOfGuestStudents as int (not double). This keeps getTotalNumberOfStudents() returning int consistent and requires no casting. Also update any example text accordingly.\n2) If fractional student counts were intended (unlikely): change the solution and template to use double for those two attributes and either change getTotalNumberOfStudents() to return double in the UML and implementations, or explicitly document/implement a cast to int when returning the total. Prefer option (1) for clarity."
