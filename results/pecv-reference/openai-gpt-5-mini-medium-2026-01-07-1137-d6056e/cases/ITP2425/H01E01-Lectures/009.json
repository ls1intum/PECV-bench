      "description": "Visibility mismatch for attributes: the UML in the problem statement shows the Lecture attributes as private ('-lectureName', '-numberOfInscribedStudents', etc.), and the solution implementation declares all attributes as private. However, the template repository pre-declares two attributes (lectureName and numberOfInscribedStudents) as public. This discrepancy between the UML/specification and the template can confuse students about the intended encapsulation (whether fields should be private with getters/setters) and may lead to inconsistent implementations or style mistakes.",

This keeps the template consistent with the specification and the solution and avoids confusing students about encapsulation. If the template intended to provide starter fields, add a short comment explaining they are intentionally public (if so) \u2014 otherwise change them to private."
