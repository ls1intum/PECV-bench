      "description": "The solution defines the Lecture constructor with package-private visibility (no access modifier) while the problem statement asks students to \"Create a constructor\" without specifying visibility. This can be confusing and may prevent students/tests outside the package from instantiating Lecture (e.g., unit tests in a different package), since a package-private constructor is not accessible outside de.tum.cit.ase. The template leaves the constructor as a TODO (no signature), so there is no explicit guidance to students that the constructor should be public. To avoid accidental accessibility problems and align with typical expectations (public constructor for instantiation), the constructor should be declared public.",
