      "description": "The problem statement and UML specify SealSaloon.calculateTotalPrice(Meal) should return a double (the text explicitly asks for double precision), but the solution implements calculateTotalPrice as returning an int. This is a method return-type mismatch: students following the spec will implement/expect a double, while the provided solution/code uses int. This can cause confusion and test mismatches (signed return type differs from specification).",

If integer prices are intended, update the problem text/UML to indicate an int return type instead."

      "description": "The problem text instructs that the SealSaloon should have a final Stock stock initialized to a default value \"in the constructor\" and also requires that the stock attribute be static (shared across instances). Assigning a static final field in an instance constructor is not appropriate in Java: static final fields must be initialized at the declaration or in a static initializer. This creates a contradiction for students (final + static + 'initialize in constructor') and may block or confuse implementations.",

Update the problem statement to explicitly state how and where the static final stock should be initialized so students are not led to an impossible implementation."
