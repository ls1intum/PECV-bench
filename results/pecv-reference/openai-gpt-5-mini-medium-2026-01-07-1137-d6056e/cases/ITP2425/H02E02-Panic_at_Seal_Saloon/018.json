      "description": "The problem statement and UML explicitly require a method named checkOrderReady() on SealSaloon (used by orderMeal() to attempt serving queued orders). The solution implementation instead defines a method named processOrders() and orderMeal() calls processOrders(). This is a signature/name mismatch for a core method students are expected to implement (and tests/instructions reference checkOrderReady()). The discrepancy in method name can confuse students about which method to implement and may cause automated checks or student expectations (based on the problem text/UML) to fail.",
