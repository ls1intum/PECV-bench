    {
      "description": "The problem statement specifies a SealSaloon attribute totalOrders with type int (non-static). The solution implementation declares totalOrders as a long. This is a structural type mismatch for a core attribute described in the specification and may confuse students about the intended type and the return type of the getter (and could cause test expectations to diverge).",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the type of totalOrders consistent with the problem statement. Change the solution's declaration from `private long totalOrders = 0;` to `private int totalOrders = 0;` and adjust the getter signature to return int (e.g., `public int getTotalOrders()`). Alternatively, update the problem statement to accept a long if larger range is intended \u2014 but prefer changing the solution to int to match the given specification and UML."
