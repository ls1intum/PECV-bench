The solution implementation provides a static method with equivalent behavior but a different name: receiveDelivery(String, int, int). This name/signature mismatch between the specification and the solution will confuse students and (if tests expect acceptSupplyDelivery) make it impossible to match the required API.",

Initializing a static field in an instance constructor is contradictory: a static field is normally initialized at declaration or in a static initializer, not per-instance in the constructor. This internal contradiction in the specification can confuse students about where/how to initialize the static stock field.",
