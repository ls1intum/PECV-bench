      "description": "The problem statement's UML and the solution expect a Stock method named addToStockIngredients(StockIngredient) (used to add a new StockIngredient), but the template Stock class provides a method named addItem(StockIngredient) instead. This name/signature mismatch is structural: students following the UML or the example code in the statement will attempt to call addToStockIngredients and will not find it in the provided template. Conversely, if they use addItem, their code will deviate from the intended API shown in the UML and the reference solution. This can confuse students implementing SealSaloon.acceptSupplyDelivery (which per the spec should add a new StockIngredient to the Stock) and may lead to failing tests or unnecessary friction.",
