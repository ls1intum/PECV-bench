      "description": "The problem statement first describes the SealSaloon having a 'final Stock stock' that should be initialized in the constructor (an instance field) but later explicitly states that the 'stock' attribute must be static (shared across all instances). This is contradictory: an instruction to initialize stock in the constructor implies an instance (non-static) field, while the later requirement mandates a static field. The solution/template implement 'stock' as a static final field initialized at declaration. Students may be confused whether to implement stock as an instance final field (initialized in the constructor) or as a static field, and initialization guidance (in constructor) is invalid for a static field.",

If stock should be an instance field, remove the later note that it must be static. Make the problem statement consistent with the template/solution (which use 'private static final Stock stock')."

      "description": "The UML and textual description in the problem statement declare orderMeal(Meal) with a void return type, but the reference solution's SealSaloon.orderMeal method returns boolean. This is a signature mismatch: students implementing the method exactly as the UML (void) will produce a different signature than the provided solution, and tests or reference behavior may expect the boolean return. This can lead to compilation/test failures or confusion about what to return.",
