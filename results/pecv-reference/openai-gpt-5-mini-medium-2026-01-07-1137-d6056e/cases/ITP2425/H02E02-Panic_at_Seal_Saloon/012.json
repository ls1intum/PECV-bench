      "description": "The problem statement and UML refer to a class named \"Stock\" (and require a static final Stock stock in SealSaloon), but the template and solution repositories provide a fully implemented class named Inventory with the expected methods (add, take, findStockIngredient, addToStockIngredients, emptyStock). Meanwhile Stock.java in both template and solution repositories is empty. This naming/type mismatch between the specification (Stock) and the provided code (Inventory) is likely unintentional and will confuse students: they will look for or try to instantiate/modify a Stock class as described in the statement but find no implementation, or they may implement SealSaloon with the wrong type and face compilation errors or inconsistency with tests and examples.",

Ensure the template does not include an unexpected empty Stock.java file. This will remove student confusion and ensure SealSaloon.stock uses the same type in problem, template and solution."

Additionally, Stock.java is present but empty in both template and solution repositories. This name mismatch (Stock vs Inventory) makes it unclear to students which class they should use or implement to satisfy the problem's requirements and where to find the expected methods/field, creating unnecessary mapping overhead.",
