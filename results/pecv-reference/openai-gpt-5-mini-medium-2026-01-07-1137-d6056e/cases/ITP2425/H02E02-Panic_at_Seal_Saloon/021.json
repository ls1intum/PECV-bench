      "description": "Type of the price field for StockIngredient is inconsistent between the problem statement/UML and the template code. The UML and problem text specify price as int (StockIngredient(String, int, int) and -price: int), and the provided solution uses an int price. However, the template repository's StockIngredient defines price as a double (private final double price) and exposes getPrice() returning double. This discrepancy will confuse students: the problem requires calculateTotalPrice to return an int and acceptSupplyDelivery to take an int price, but using the template class's double getPrice() will cause a type mismatch (e.g., adding a double into an int accumulator causes a compilation error unless explicitly cast).",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the price type consistent across artifacts. Change the template StockIngredient.price and its constructor/getPrice() to use int (matching the UML and solution), i.e., private final int price; constructor StockIngredient(String name, int price, int quantity); public int getPrice(). Alternatively, update the problem statement and solution to accept double prices everywhere, but the simpler fix is to change the template to int to match the specification and reference solution."
