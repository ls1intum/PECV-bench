      "description": "The problem text instructs that both attributes (orders and stock) \"should be initialized to default values ... in the constructor of SealSaloon\" (so instance initialization), while elsewhere it explicitly requires the stock attribute to be static (shared across all instances). These two requirements conflict: a static (class) field is not conceptually initialized per-instance in the constructor. This ambiguity can confuse students whether stock should be an instance final field initialized in the constructor or a static final field initialized at declaration or in a static initializer. The reference solution implements stock as a private static final field initialized at its declaration, which resolves the conflict but differs from the earlier instruction to initialize in the constructor.",

Either (A) require stock to be an instance final field and instruct students to initialize it in the constructor, or (B) require stock to be static final (shared) and instruct students to initialize it at declaration or in a static initializer (and remove the sentence that says to initialize stock in the constructor). Prefer option B to match the intended shared-stock design and the reference solution."

      "description": "The UML and text indicate acceptSupplyDelivery should be a public method (the UML shows a '+' public visibility), and the problem statement explicitly states that acceptSupplyDelivery must be static. The reference implementation makes acceptSupplyDelivery static but with package-private (default) visibility (no 'public' modifier). This is a visibility mismatch between the specification (public) and the solution (package-private), which may confuse students about the intended visibility and access level for this method.",

Either update the reference solution (and template/instructions) to declare acceptSupplyDelivery as public static, or update the problem/UML to indicate package-private visibility (remove the '+' in UML and state package-level visibility). The simplest fix to match the UML/spec is to change the method signature in the solution to 'public static void acceptSupplyDelivery(...)'."
