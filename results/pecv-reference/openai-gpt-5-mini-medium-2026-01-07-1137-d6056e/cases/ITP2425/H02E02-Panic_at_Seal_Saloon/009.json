      "description": "The problem statement and UML describe/expect a fully implemented class named Meal (with constructor Meal(String, String[]) and getters). The template repository, however, does not contain an implementation of Meal (Meal.java is empty) and instead provides a class named Order with the Meal-like API. The solution repository implements Meal as expected. This type/class-name mismatch (Order vs Meal) and the missing Meal implementation in the template will confuse students: they will either have to recreate/rename classes to match the specification or change references in the problem/solution, and the provided starter code will not compile/run as intended for the exercise described.",

This creates an unnecessary naming mismatch: students reading the problem expect to find/extend a Meal class in the starter code, but the template provides an identically purposed class under the different identifier 'Order'. This mismatch can confuse students about which class to use/modify and forces them to map the conceptual entity 'Meal' <-> implementation 'Order' (extra cognitive load) or to rename files/classes manually.",
