      "description": "The problem statement explicitly requires calculateTotalPrice to be a static method that uses the shared static stock (see problem notes). In the provided solution, calculateTotalPrice is implemented as an instance method (non-static). This mismatch about the method being static vs. instance can confuse students about the intended API and how to access shared stock (static vs. instance access), and may cause their implementations or tests to fail if they follow the problem's static requirement.",

Make calculateTotalPrice a static method: change its signature to public static int calculateTotalPrice(Meal meal) and update any calls to it accordingly (e.g., SealSaloon.calculateTotalPrice(meal)). Alternatively, if the intended design is for calculateTotalPrice to be an instance method, remove or revise the problem statement note that requires it to be static so the specification and solution match."
