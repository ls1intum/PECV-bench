      "description": "The problem statement first instructs that both attributes (orders and stock) should be initialized in the SealSaloon constructor (per-instance), then later requires the stock attribute to be static/shared across all instances. These two requirements conflict: a static (class) field is not meaningfully \"initialized in the constructor\" for each instance. This contradiction can confuse students about whether stock should be an instance-final field set in the constructor or a static field shared across all SealSaloon instances. The reference solution uses a static final stock, which follows the later instruction, but the earlier wording and example in the problem encourage per-instance initialization.",

Update the wording consistently across the problem statement and any UML notes so students know whether stock is instance-scoped or class-scoped."

      "description": "The problem statement and UML specify that the orders attribute should be a modifiable List<Meal> (i.e., use java.util.List), but the reference solution implements orders as a Meal[] array. This mismatch between 'List' in the specification and 'array' in the solution could confuse students about the intended data structure (and whether they should use List APIs or array helpers). The template repository also provides ArrayHelpers (array-based utilities), which suggests arrays are intended, increasing the ambiguity.",
