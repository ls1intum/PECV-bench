      "description": "The problem statement and UML specify calculateRemainingOrderNumber() as returning an int (UML: +calculateRemainingOrderNumber(): int; text: \"implement a method calculateRemainingOrderNumber() that returns the number of remaining orders as an integer\"), but the solution implements calculateRemainingOrderNumber() as void and prints order numbers instead of returning an int. This is a direct signature/behavior mismatch: students following the spec would implement and/or tests may expect an int return value, while the solution uses a void printing method. This mismatch will confuse students about the required method contract and may break automated tests or grading that expect an int result.",

Either: (A) Change the solution (and any reference implementation/tests) so calculateRemainingOrderNumber() returns an int (e.g., return this.orders.length) and avoid printing inside the method; or (B) Update the problem statement and UML to declare calculateRemainingOrderNumber() as void and document that it prints the remaining order numbers. Prefer option A to match the current textual requirement that it should return the number of remaining orders."

      "description": "The problem text instructs students to initialize the SealSaloon attributes in the constructor (\"These should be initialized to default values ... in the constructor of SealSaloon. Hereby, the constructor takes no parameters.\"), and describes the stock as a final Stock that is read-only after construction. Immediately afterwards the problem states that the stock attribute must be static (shared across instances). This is confusing: initializing an instance field in the constructor vs. having a static (class) field are different instructions. The solution declares stock as a static final field initialized at declaration (private static final Stock stock = new Stock()). The contradictory guidance about where/how to initialize the stock (constructor vs. static/class initializer) may confuse students implementing the class.",

If stock is intended to be shared across all saloons, specify \"private static final Stock stock\" and show that it should be initialized at declaration or in a static initializer. If it should be instance-final (initialized in the constructor), remove the requirement that it be static. Update the UML and textual instructions to match the chosen approach so students know where and how to initialize the field."
