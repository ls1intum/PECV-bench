      "description": "The problem statement's UML and text describe a SealSaloon attribute totalOrders as an int (private -totalOrders: int) and instruct that it should be an instance attribute (not static). The reference solution declares this field as a long (private long totalOrders = 0;). This type mismatch (int vs long) is a structural inconsistency: students reading the UML may implement totalOrders as int while the solution/reference uses long, and automated tests or reflection-based checks that expect an int could fail or confuse students.",

Either change the solution to declare totalOrders as an int (private int totalOrders = 0;) to match the UML/problem statement, or update the problem statement/UML to indicate totalOrders is a long if larger range is desired. Ensure any tests and documentation reflect the chosen type."
