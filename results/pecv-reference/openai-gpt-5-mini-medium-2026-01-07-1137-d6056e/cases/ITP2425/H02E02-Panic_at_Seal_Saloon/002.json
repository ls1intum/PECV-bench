      "description": "The problem statement contains contradictory instructions about the SealSaloon.stock attribute (and related methods). Early in the description it instructs that the SealSaloon constructor should initialize attributes to default values (suggesting instance-level initialization of stock in the constructor). The UML and earlier text describe a final Stock stock attribute (no explicit static marker). Later, the problem explicitly states that the stock attribute (and the methods acceptSupplyDelivery and calculateTotalPrice) must be static. This is inconsistent: initializing a static stock in the instance constructor is misleading, and the UML does not indicate the static requirement. The solution implements stock as a static final field and the two methods as static, but the mixed instructions in the problem statement can confuse students about whether stock should be an instance field (final) initialized in the constructor or a static shared field.",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the problem statement consistent and explicit about the intended design. Either:\n- If stock is intended to be shared across all saloons: state clearly that stock must be declared static final and initialized as a static field (or in a static initializer), and explicitly mark acceptSupplyDelivery and calculateTotalPrice as static in the UML and text. Remove or change the instruction that suggests initializing stock in the instance constructor (leave orders to be initialized in the constructor).\n- Or, if stock should be an instance-final field: remove the note that stock and the two methods must be static and update the solution and tests accordingly.\nConcretely, update the UML (e.g., underline or annotate static members) and the prose so students are not left deciding between instance vs. static initialization."
