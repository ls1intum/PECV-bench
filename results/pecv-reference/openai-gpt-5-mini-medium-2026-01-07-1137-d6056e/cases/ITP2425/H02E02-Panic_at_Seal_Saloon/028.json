      "description": "The problem statement contains contradictory guidance about the SealSaloon.stock attribute and the static-ness of some methods. The UML section and the earlier description emphasize a final (instance) stock attribute, while a later textual note explicitly requires the stock attribute to be static and also requires calculateTotalPrice and acceptSupplyDelivery to be static. This contradiction (UML/early text vs later text) can confuse students about whether stock should be an instance field or a class (static) field and whether calculateTotalPrice/acceptSupplyDelivery should be static methods. The solution implements stock as static final and both methods as static, but the UML and the earlier prose may lead students to implement a non-static stock, causing mismatches with the intended design and tests.",

Either: (A) explicitly mark the stock attribute as static in the UML (and state in the main text that stock should be static final) and state clearly that calculateTotalPrice and acceptSupplyDelivery are static; or (B) if the intent is for per-instance stock, remove the textual requirement that these members be static and update the solution/tests accordingly. Ensure the UML, the prose, and any example code all consistently indicate static vs. instance members."
