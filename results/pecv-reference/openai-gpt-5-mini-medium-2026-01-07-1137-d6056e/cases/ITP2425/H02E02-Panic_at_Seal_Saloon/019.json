      "description": "Contradictory instructions about where to initialize the shared stock: the problem text tells students to initialize attributes (orders and stock) in the SealSaloon constructor (no-arg constructor), but elsewhere the problem explicitly requires the stock attribute to be static and final. A static final field cannot be sensibly initialized per-instance in the constructor. This creates an impossible-to-follow instruction for students (should stock be an instance field initialized in the constructor, or a static final field initialized at declaration?).",

Remove the sentence that requires initializing stock in the instance constructor to avoid the contradiction."
