      "description": "The problem statement consistently refers to a static method named calculateTotalPrice(Meal): int (UML and textual description), but both the template and the solution use the name computeMealCost(Meal) instead. This naming mismatch is a structural inconsistency in the method signature students are expected to provide: they will be told to implement/call calculateTotalPrice, while the provided Main (template) and the solution use computeMealCost. This can confuse students about the exact method name to implement and call, and may cause automated tests or starter code (Main) to fail if names differ.",

Ensure the chosen name is used in Main, the SealSaloon class, and the documentation so students implement and call the same method."
