However, the provided solution implements this method with a `void` return type and prints a sequence of 'Order number: X' messages, which contradicts the requirement to *return* the number of remaining orders. This inconsistency in method signature and expected behavior creates confusion for students trying to map the requirement to the implementation.",

The problem statement's example output (lines 101-106) and the corresponding printing logic in the solution should be re-evaluated. If printing is also a requirement, it should be clearly specified as an additional action, distinct from the method's return value, or the return type in the problem statement should be changed to `void` to align with the printing behavior."
