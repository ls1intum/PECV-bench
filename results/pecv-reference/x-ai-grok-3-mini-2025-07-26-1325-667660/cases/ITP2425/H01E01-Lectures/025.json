      "description": "The attribute 'numberOfInscribedStudents' is defined as an 'int' in the problem statement's UML diagram, but it is implemented as a 'long' in the solution repository. This discrepancy could confuse students who base their implementation on the UML diagram, leading them to use 'int' while the solution uses 'long', potentially causing inconsistencies in their code when compared to the reference solution.",
