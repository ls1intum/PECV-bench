      "description": "The addAnimal method in the Farm class is declared to return a boolean in the problem statement (indicating success or failure), but in the solution repository, it is implemented as returning void, which contradicts the specified design. This inconsistency could confuse students who follow the problem statement, leading them to expect a return value that isn't present in the provided solution.",
