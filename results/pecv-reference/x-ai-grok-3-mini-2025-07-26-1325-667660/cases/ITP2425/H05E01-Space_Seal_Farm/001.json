    {
      "description": "The problem statement specifies that the messageOnMilk() method in the Milkable interface should return a boolean value, indicating whether milking was successful, but the solution repository implements it as returning a String, which creates a direct contradiction between the intended design and the provided reference solution. This inconsistency could confuse students who follow the problem statement, leading them to implement the wrong return type and potentially fail tests or misunderstand the interface's purpose.",
