      "description": "The problem statement contains an internal contradiction regarding the 'stock' attribute in the SealSaloon class. It initially describes 'stock' as a final instance attribute (implying non-static) in lines 70-71, but later specifies it must be static in line 78. This inconsistency could confuse students about whether 'stock' should be an instance or static attribute, potentially leading to incorrect implementations that don't align with the intended shared behavior.",

However, the solution repository does not include this method; instead, it has a private method 'processOrders()' that performs similar logic. This discrepancy could confuse students, as they might implement 'checkOrderReady' as described, only to find it doesn't match the solution structure, potentially blocking them from understanding the intended design flow.",
