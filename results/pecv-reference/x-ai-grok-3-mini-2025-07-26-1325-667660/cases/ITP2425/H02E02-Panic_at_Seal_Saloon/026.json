      "description": "The conceptual entity representing the name of a StockIngredient is referred to as 'name' in the problem statement, implemented as 'getIngredientName()' in the template repository, and as 'getName()' in the solution repository. This discrepancy in method naming for the same attribute could confuse students, as they may struggle to map the problem's description to the template's implementation and then to the solution's final version, potentially leading to errors in their code.",
