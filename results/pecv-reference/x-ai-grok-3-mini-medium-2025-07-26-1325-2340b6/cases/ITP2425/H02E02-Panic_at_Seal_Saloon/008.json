      "description": "The problem statement specifies that the method calculateRemainingOrderNumber() in the SealSaloon class should return an integer representing the number of remaining orders, but the solution implements it as a void method that only prints the order numbers without returning a value. This discrepancy could confuse students who refer to the solution for guidance, leading them to implement a void method instead of one that returns an int, thus deviating from the specified design.",
