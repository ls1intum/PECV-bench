    {
      "description": "The problem statement inconsistently describes the 'stock' attribute in SealSaloon as both a static field that must be shared across instances and as something to be initialized in the constructor, which is not possible for static fields. This contradiction could confuse students about how to handle static versus instance initialization, potentially leading them to incorrectly implement the attribute or misunderstand object-oriented principles.",
