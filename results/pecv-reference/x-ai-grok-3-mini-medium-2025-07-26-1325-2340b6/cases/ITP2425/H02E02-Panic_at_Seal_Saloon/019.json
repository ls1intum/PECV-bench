      "description": "The method checkOrderReady() is described in the problem statement as returning void, but in the solution repository, it is implemented to return a boolean. This discrepancy could confuse students who follow the problem statement's UML diagram, leading them to implement it as void, only to find that the solution expects a boolean return type, potentially causing inconsistencies in their code and grading mismatches.",
