      "description": "The problem statement text refers to the attribute as 'inscribedStudents', while the UML diagram within the same problem statement and the solution repository use 'numberOfInscribedStudents' for the same conceptual entity (the attribute representing the number of inscribed students). This discrepancy could confuse students by creating a mismatch between the task description and the expected implementation, leading to difficulties in mapping requirements to code.",
