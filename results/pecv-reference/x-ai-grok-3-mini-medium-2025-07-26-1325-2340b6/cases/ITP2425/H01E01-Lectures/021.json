      "description": "The problem statement refers to the main class as 'Lecture' in the text descriptions and tasks, but the embedded UML diagram incorrectly labels it as 'Course'. This discrepancy could confuse students by implying that the class represents a different concept, making it difficult to map the requirements from the text to the diagram and subsequently to the template and solution code.",
