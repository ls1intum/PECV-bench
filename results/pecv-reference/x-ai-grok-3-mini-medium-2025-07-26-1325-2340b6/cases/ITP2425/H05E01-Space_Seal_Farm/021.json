      "description": "The problem statement specifies that the Farm class should have a constructor with no arguments to initialize the ArrayList of animals, but the solution repository implements a constructor that requires an integer parameter for initial capacity. This discrepancy is compounded by the Main class in the solution attempting to instantiate Farm without arguments, which would result in a compilation error. This creates confusion for students who follow the problem statement, as they may implement a no-arg constructor only to find the solution structure incompatible, potentially blocking them from understanding the intended design.",
