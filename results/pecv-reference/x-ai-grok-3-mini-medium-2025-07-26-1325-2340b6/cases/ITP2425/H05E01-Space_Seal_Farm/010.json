    {
      "description": "The 'animals' attribute in the Farm class is declared as public in the solution repository, but the problem statement's UML diagram specifies it as private. This discrepancy could confuse students about proper encapsulation and visibility modifiers, potentially leading them to implement attributes without adhering to the intended design principles.",
