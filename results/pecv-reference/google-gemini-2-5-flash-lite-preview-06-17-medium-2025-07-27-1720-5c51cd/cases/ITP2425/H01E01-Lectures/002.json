      "description": "The problem statement implies a `String` return type for the `toString()` method through its example output format. The solution repository, however, declares the `toString()` method with a return type of `Object`. This is a structural inconsistency because the standard `toString()` method in Java, which is intended to be overridden, has a `String` return type. The presence of the `@Override` annotation in the solution further indicates an intent to override `Object.toString()`, but the `Object` return type makes this signature invalid for a correct override. This mismatch could lead to compilation errors or prevent students from correctly implementing the method as expected.",
