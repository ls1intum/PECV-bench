      "description": "The problem statement first says to initialize both `orders` and `stock` in the instance constructor (lines 70–71), but then later requires `stock` to be static (lines 78–80). In Java, static final fields cannot be assigned in the instance constructor. This contradiction will confuse students and lead to compilation errors if they try to follow both instructions.",
