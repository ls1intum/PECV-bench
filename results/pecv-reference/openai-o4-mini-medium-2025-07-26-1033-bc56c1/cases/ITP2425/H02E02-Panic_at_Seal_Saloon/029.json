      "description": "The problem statement instructs students to initialize the `stock` attribute in the `SealSaloon` constructor, but then specifies that `stock` must be a static field. In Java, static fields cannot be initialized in an instance constructor, so students will be confused whether to make `stock` static (and initialize at declaration or in a static block) or non-static and initialize in the constructor. The solution initializes `stock` at its declaration rather than in the constructor, deviating from the initial instruction.",
