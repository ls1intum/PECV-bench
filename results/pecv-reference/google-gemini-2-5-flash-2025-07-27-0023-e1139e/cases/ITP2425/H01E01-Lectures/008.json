      "description": "The problem statement (line 31) asks to 'Implement Getters' without explicitly specifying their visibility. Standard practice for getters is to be public. However, the solution implements `getLectureName()` and `getNumberOfInscribedStudents()` as private, while other getters in the same class (e.g., `getNumberOfGuestStudents()`, `getNumberOfLecturers()`, `getNumberOfTutors()`) are implemented as public. This inconsistency in visibility for getters within the solution itself is confusing and deviates from common Java conventions, potentially leading students to implement them incorrectly or be confused by the solution's structure.",

However, the solution repository implements `getLectureName()` and `getNumberOfInscribedStudents()` with a `private` access modifier, while other getters are correctly `public`. This inconsistency in access modifiers for methods that are conceptually public getters creates confusion and prevents external code from accessing these attributes, leading to compilation errors or test failures for students.",
