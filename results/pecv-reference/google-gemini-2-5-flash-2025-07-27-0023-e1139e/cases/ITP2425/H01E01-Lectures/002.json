      "description": "The `toString()` method in the solution repository has a return type of `Object`, but the standard Java `toString()` method (which is implied by the problem statement's request for a 'custom toString() method' and its example usage) must override `java.lang.Object.toString()` and therefore have a `String` return type. This is a structural inconsistency that could lead to compilation warnings or unexpected behavior if not corrected to `String`.",

      "description": "The problem statement implies implementing the standard Java `toString()` method, which has a `String` return type and is typically overridden from `java.lang.Object`. However, the solution repository's `toString()` method is declared with an `Object` return type (`public Object toString()`). This is an incorrect signature for overriding `java.lang.Object.toString()` (which returns `String`). Consequently, the `@Override` annotation on line 63 of the solution code will cause a compilation error. If the `@Override` annotation were removed, this method would not be called automatically by `System.out.println()` or similar mechanisms, leading to a broken implementation that does not fulfill the requirement of providing a custom string representation for the `Lecture` object.",
