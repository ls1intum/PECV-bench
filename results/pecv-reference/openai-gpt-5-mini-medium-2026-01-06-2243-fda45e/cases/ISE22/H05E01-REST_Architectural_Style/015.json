      "description": "The solution implementation of PersonService makes its core methods protected (savePerson, deletePerson, getAllPersons) while the template had them public. PersonResource (in package de.tum.in.ase.eist.rest) invokes these methods. Because PersonResource is in a different package and is not a subclass of PersonService, it cannot legally call protected methods of PersonService. This creates a visibility/access mismatch that will cause compilation errors and prevents the server-side REST endpoints from working as shown in the solution.",

The simplest fix is to make PersonService.savePerson, PersonService.deletePerson and PersonService.getAllPersons public (as they are in the template), or keep them package-accessible and place PersonResource in the same package. Making the methods public matches the template, restores compile-time accessibility, and preserves the intended layering."
