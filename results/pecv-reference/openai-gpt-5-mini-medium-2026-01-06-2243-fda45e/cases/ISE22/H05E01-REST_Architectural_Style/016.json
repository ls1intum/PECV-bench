      "description": "The visibility of Person model fields is inconsistent across artifacts: the problem statement's UML specifies the Person attributes as private (shown with '-' in the UML), and the template's Person.java declares the fields as private. However, the solution's Person.java declares the same fields as public. This breaks encapsulation implied by the problem UML and the template, and may confuse students who expect private fields with getters/setters (and could mislead when comparing to the reference solution).",

Concretely, change the field declarations in solution_repository/src/common/java/de/tum/in/ase/eist/model/Person.java from 'public' to 'private'. This preserves the intended design (private attributes with accessors) and avoids confusing students comparing template and solution code."
