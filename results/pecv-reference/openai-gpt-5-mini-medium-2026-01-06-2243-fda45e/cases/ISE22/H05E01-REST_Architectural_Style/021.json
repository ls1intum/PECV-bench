      "description": "The solution repository changes PersonService from an instance-based, dependency-injected service (as provided in the template and described in the problem) into a singleton/static API (static savePerson/getAllPersons/deletePerson and getInstance()). PersonResource in the solution then mixes static and instance usage: createPerson calls the static PersonService.savePerson(...), while updatePerson and getAllPersons call the injected personService instance methods. This is a structural inconsistency: the template and problem expect an instance service injected into the resource, but the solution both converts the service to static/singleton and calls it inconsistently from PersonResource. The result is code that contradicts the intended dependency-injection design and (as written) will not compile \u2014 confusing students and preventing them from following the intended implementation pattern.",

Concretely, make PersonService methods non-static (public Person savePerson(Person), public void deletePerson(UUID), public List<Person> getAllPersons(PersonSortingOptions)) and remove the singleton/getInstance static wrappers. Then update PersonResource to call the injected personService instance for all operations (personService.savePerson(...), personService.getAllPersons(...), personService.deletePerson(...)). This preserves the intended DI design, compiles, and matches the problem statement and template structure."

      "description": "The problem statement and template expect PersonService to be a normal injectable service that the REST resource forwards to (Part 1: \"forward each action to the PersonService\"). In the template PersonService the key operations are instance methods (e.g. savePerson, deletePerson, getAllPersons). The solution, however, modifies PersonService to expose static fa\u00e7ade methods (e.g. public static Person savePerson(...), public static List<Person> getAllPersons(...)) and also introduces differently named internal instance methods (savePersonInternal / getAllPersonsInternal). The solution's PersonResource calls the service inconsistently \u2014 createPerson calls the static PersonService.savePerson(...) while updatePerson calls the injected instance personService.savePerson(...). This breaks the simple conceptual mapping from the problem (use the injected PersonService) to the code, and creates confusion for students about whether PersonService should be used as an injected instance or via static methods.",

Alternatively, if static methods are intended (not recommended for this exercise), update the problem statement and template to clearly document and use a static API and make all calls in PersonResource consistently static.
