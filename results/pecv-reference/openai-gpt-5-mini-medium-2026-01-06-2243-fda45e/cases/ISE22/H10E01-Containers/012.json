      "description": "The problem statement explicitly says the 'parents' attribute is a List that preserves insertion order (problem_statement.md lines ~96-97). However, both the template and solution Person.java declare 'parents' as a Set (HashSet) (template: template_repository/src/main/java/de/tum/in/ase/eist/model/Person.java, line ~40; solution: solution_repository/src/main/java/de/tum/in/ase/eist/model/Person.java, line ~40). This is a structural type mismatch: a List preserves insertion order and allows indexed semantics, while a Set (HashSet) does not guarantee insertion order. Students expecting a List (per the problem text) may be confused about which collection type to use and may implement incompatible code. It also affects the intended behavior about \"first two added parents\" and how ordering or duplicates are treated.",

If preserving insertion order in the persisted relationship is required, also add the appropriate JPA annotation (e.g., @OrderColumn) to the ManyToMany mapping so insertion order is persisted. Choose the option that matches the intended scoring/tests and update all artifacts (problem text, template code, and solution) accordingly."

This is a semantic mismatch of the same conceptual entity (the parents collection): the problem describes an ordered List while the code uses an unordered Set.
