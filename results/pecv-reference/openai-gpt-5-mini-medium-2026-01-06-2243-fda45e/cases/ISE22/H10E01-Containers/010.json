      "description": "The problem statement says the Person.birthday should be stored as an ISO-8601 formatted String, but both the template and the solution define the birthday field as java.time.LocalDate (with getters/setters using LocalDate). This is a type mismatch that will confuse students: they may implement code or tests assuming a String and then encounter compilation/serialization issues, and the provided tests and solution expect LocalDate semantics (e.g., ObjectMapper modules for date handling).",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the representation of birthday consistent across artifacts. The simplest fix is to update the problem statement to specify that birthday is stored as java.time.LocalDate (and mention JSON serialization uses ISO-8601 via ObjectMapper modules). Alternatively, if the intent is to use a String, change the template and solution Person.birthday field and its getters/setters to String and adjust validation and tests accordingly. Prefer updating the problem statement to LocalDate to match the code and tests."
