      "description": "Visibility mismatch for the controller handler method createPerson in PersonResource: the template declares the method as public but the solution implementation omits the public modifier (package-private). This is an inconsistent visibility between template and solution and may confuse students about the expected access level for REST controller handler methods (typically public). While this does not change the method signature or behavior in many setups, it is a structural inconsistency across the provided artifacts and could lead to uncertainty or subtle issues depending on Spring version/configuration.",

Either add the 'public' modifier to createPerson in the solution repository or remove it in the template (i.e., make both versions the same). Best practice: mark all REST endpoint methods as public to avoid ambiguity."
