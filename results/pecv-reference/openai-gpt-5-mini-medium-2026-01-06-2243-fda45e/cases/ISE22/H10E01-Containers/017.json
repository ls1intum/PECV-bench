      "description": "The problem statement refers to a method named `linkParent(Person person, Person parent)` (lines 101) but the template and solution define and expect a method named `addParent(Person person, Person parent)`. This name mismatch can confuse students looking for `linkParent` in the template code and in the tests to implement. Additionally, the explanatory sentence about saving the relation mixes variable names (it says \"add `parent` to the `person`'s list of parents\" but uses the example `linkParent(person: Person, parent: Person)` and later refers to \"child\"), which may further confuse which parameter represents the child vs. the parent.",

Save and return the updated person.\" This keeps the specification consistent with the provided code and tests."
