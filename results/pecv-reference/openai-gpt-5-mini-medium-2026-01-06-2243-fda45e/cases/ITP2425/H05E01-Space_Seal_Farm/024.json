      "description": "The problem statement contains an internal contradiction about the collection type for Farm.animals: the UML diagram and several places refer to animals as a List<Animal>, while the textual instructions under \"Part 3\" explicitly require the aggregation to be realized using a Set implemented with a HashSet and initialized in the no-arg constructor. Students will be unsure whether they must implement a List (as shown in the UML) or a Set/HashSet (as specified in the text), which affects the field type, constructor, getter/setter signatures, and behavior (uniqueness/no-duplicates).",

This mismatch (List vs Set/HashSet) creates ambiguity for students about which data structure to implement and why, and may lead to unnecessary confusion or incorrect implementations relative to the written instructions or tests.",
