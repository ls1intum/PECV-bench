      "description": "The problem statement requires Farm to hold its animals in a List and explicitly instructs to implement it using an ArrayList (Part 3, lines describing aggregation). The solution implementation, however, uses a Queue<Animal> backed by a LinkedList (solution_repository/src/de/tum/cit/ase/Farm.java). This creates a structural mismatch: the field type, constructor initialization, and getter/setter signatures in the solution differ from the data structure (List/ArrayList) specified in the exercise. Students following the problem text (or automated tests expecting List/ArrayList types and methods) could be confused or unable to match the reference implementation or tests.",

Adjust addAnimal(), feedAllAnimals(), and singFarmSong() implementations to operate on a List. Alternatively (less preferred), update the problem statement to accept Queue/LinkedList if that design is intentional \u2014 but prefer aligning the solution with the stated requirement to use List/ArrayList."

The solution implementation instead declares the collection as a Queue<Animal> and initializes it with a LinkedList. This changes the type identifier (List/ArrayList vs Queue/LinkedList) for the same conceptual entity (the collection of animals) and can confuse students: they are told to use List/ArrayList but the reference solution uses different collection types and names.",
