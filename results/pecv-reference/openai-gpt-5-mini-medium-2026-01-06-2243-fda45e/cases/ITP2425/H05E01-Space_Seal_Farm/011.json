    {
      "description": "The UML in the problem statement specifies the Animal attribute 'name' as type String, but the solution implementation uses a StringBuilder field for the name. This is a structural type mismatch for a core attribute: students reading the UML expect to implement a private String name and corresponding getter/setter, while the reference solution stores the name as a StringBuilder. Although this difference does not change runtime behavior of the provided methods, it is a structural inconsistency that could confuse students about the intended attribute type.",

Alternatively, if StringBuilder is intentional, update the problem statement/UML to indicate the attribute type is StringBuilder so students are not misled."
