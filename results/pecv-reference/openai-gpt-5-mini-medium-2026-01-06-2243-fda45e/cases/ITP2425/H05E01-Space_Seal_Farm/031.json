      "description": "The problem statement (UML and explicit note) requires the Animal class to expose the name accessor methods with protected visibility and shows the Animal(String) constructor as protected. The reference solution implements the constructor and the get/set accessors as public in Animal.java. This visibility mismatch between the specification (protected constructor + protected getter/setter) and the solution (public constructor + public getter/setter) can confuse students about the intended visibility and inheritance design and may lead them to implement a different API than the reference solution.",

Alternatively, if public access was intended, update the problem statement/UML to show the constructor and accessors as public and remove the note asking for protected visibility so students are not misled."
