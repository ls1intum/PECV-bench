    {
      "description": "The problem statement (UML and tasks) specify that Farm has a private attribute \"animals: List<Animal>\" and explicitly instructs students to provide a getter and setter. In the reference solution, the animals field is declared public (public List<Animal> animals;). This contradicts the intended encapsulation and the explicit task instructions (private attribute + getter/setter). Students comparing their implementation to the reference may be confused about the intended visibility (private vs public) and about why a public field exists alongside getter/setter, which undermines the lesson on encapsulation.",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the animals attribute private in the reference solution (and in any template guidance) to match the UML and the task instructions. For example, change the declaration to: private List<Animal> animals; and keep the provided getter and setter. Alternatively, if the intention was to teach a public field, update the problem statement/UML to reflect a public attribute and remove the instruction to implement getter/setter. The preferred fix is to make the field private to preserve the encapsulation lesson."
