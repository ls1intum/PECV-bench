      "description": "The UML in the problem statement shows Animal.messageOnFeed() as a public abstract method (+ messageOnFeed(): String), but in the solution Animal.java declares the method as protected abstract String messageOnFeed(). This is a visibility mismatch: the problem (and UML) imply a public abstract contract while the solution uses protected. Students reading the UML may implement messageOnFeed() as public in their Animal class, and the discrepancy between UML/spec and the reference implementation can cause confusion about the intended visibility.",

Either update Animal.java in the solution to declare the abstract method as public (public abstract String messageOnFeed();) to match the UML/problem statement, or adjust the UML/problem text to indicate the method is protected. The simplest correction to align artifacts is to change the method declaration in Animal.java to public abstract String messageOnFeed()."
