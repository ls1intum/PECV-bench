      "description": "The problem statement's text instructs students to implement the helper method singFarmSongVerse(Animal animal) as public (for easier testing), but the UML in the same problem statement marks singFarmSongVerse as private. The template Farm.java currently declares a private singFarmSongVerse (and lacks the Animal parameter in the stub), and the provided solution implements singFarmSongVerse as private with the Animal parameter. This inconsistency (text vs. UML) and the mismatch between the problem text expectation (public) and the template/solution (private) can confuse students and/or break automated tests that expect a public helper method.",

Either: (A) Update the problem statement text to match the UML (state that singFarmSongVerse should be private) and keep the template/solution private; or (B) change the template and solution to declare singFarmSongVerse as public with the signature public void singFarmSongVerse(Animal animal) (and update the UML to show it as public). Also ensure the template stub includes the Animal parameter so students have the correct signature to implement."
