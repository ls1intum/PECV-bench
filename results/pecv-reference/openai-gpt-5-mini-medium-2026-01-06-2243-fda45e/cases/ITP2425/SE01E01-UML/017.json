      "description": "The UML/problem statement declares the Pneumatic interface with methods raisePressure(int) and openValve(). In the solution, Pneumatic.java declares raisePressure(int) and releasePressure() (method name mismatch), while the solution classes LaunchedDropdownTower and LaunchedRollerCoaster implement a method named openValve(). This creates a signature/name mismatch between the interface and the implementing classes (and contradicts the UML). As written, the solution is internally inconsistent and would not compile: implementing classes do not implement the interface method releasePressure(), and the interface does not declare openValve() as required by the UML/problem. This will confuse students about the correct method name to use and prevents following the intended design.",

In the solution repository, the Pneumatic interface declares raisePressure(int) and releasePressure() (different name). Meanwhile the solution's LaunchedDropdownTower and LaunchedRollerCoaster classes override openValve(). This creates a direct naming mismatch: the interface method in the solution is called releasePressure(), but the UML/problem and the implementing classes use openValve().
