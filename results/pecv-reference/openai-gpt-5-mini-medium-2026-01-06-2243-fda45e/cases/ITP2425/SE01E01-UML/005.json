      "description": "Constructor parameter order for RollerCoaster is inconsistent between the solution classes and the constructor-order rule in the problem statement. The problem statement requires constructors to take attributes in the same order as they appear in the UML (inherited attributes first: Ride.name, Ride.abbreviation, then RollerCoaster.numberOfLoopings). LaunchedRollerCoaster\u2019s constructor (and its super(...) call) in the solution uses the order (String name, char abbreviation, int numberOfLoopings), but RollerCoaster\u2019s constructor in the solution is declared as (String name, int numberOfLoopings, char abbreviation). This mismatch would prevent the code from compiling and confuses students about the expected parameter ordering for subclass constructors that must forward inherited attributes.",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the RollerCoaster constructor follow the natural attribute order (inherited Ride attributes first, then RollerCoaster attributes). For example change RollerCoaster\u2019s constructor signature to public RollerCoaster(String name, char abbreviation, int numberOfLoopings) { super(name, abbreviation); this.numberOfLoopings = numberOfLoopings; } This matches LaunchedRollerCoaster\u2019s constructor and the UML/constructor-order rule and will avoid compilation errors and student confusion. Alternatively, if the current RollerCoaster order was intentional, update LaunchedRollerCoaster to call the same parameter order and document the rationale \u2014 but the first option preserves consistency with the UML and the exercise instructions."
