    {
      "description": "The UML/problem statement declares RollerCoaster.numberOfLoopings as an int, but the solution implementation declares numberOfLoopings as a double in RollerCoaster. Additionally, the solution's LaunchedRollerCoaster constructor takes an int for numberOfLoopings while RollerCoaster's constructor takes a double, creating an inconsistent constructor/attribute typing across classes. This deviates from the UML (which specifies int) and can confuse students about the correct attribute and constructor types to implement and test against.",

Either change RollerCoaster.numberOfLoopings and its constructor parameter in the solution from double to int (recommended, to match the UML) and keep LaunchedRollerCoaster's constructor taking an int, or update the UML/problem statement to specify double everywhere if double is intended. Ensure all constructors and getters use the same type across RollerCoaster and its subclasses."
