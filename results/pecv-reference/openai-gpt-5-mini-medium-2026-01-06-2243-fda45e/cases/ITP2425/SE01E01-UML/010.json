    {
      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares Ride.abbreviation as type String (problem_statement.md: lines 21-24), but the solution implements Ride.abbreviation as a char and uses char in constructors and getters (solution_repository/src/de/tum/in/ase/Ride.java and RollerCoaster.java). This is an attribute/signature mismatch: students reading the UML will expect a String abbreviation and may implement constructors/getters accordingly, while the provided solution uses char. This discrepancy can cause confusion about the expected type and lead to failing signature/constructor checks.",

Either (A) change the UML / problem statement to declare abbreviation: char (and update any textual references), or (B) change the solution and template implementations to use String for abbreviation (update field, constructor parameters and getter return type accordingly). Choose the option that matches the intended exercise expectations and update all artifacts so students see a single, consistent type."
