      "description": "The problem statement explicitly requires that the constructor of LaunchedRollerCoaster must accept only (name, abbreviation) (see Tasks). The solution implementation of LaunchedRollerCoaster provides a constructor with signature (String name, char abbreviation, int numberOfLoopings). This contradicts the stated constructor requirement and would confuse students about which constructor they must implement. Additionally, RollerCoaster only defines a constructor that requires numberOfLoopings, so if students implement the two-argument LaunchedRollerCoaster as required by the problem, they would be forced to either call a non-existent super(...) constructor or choose a default handling\u2014this structural mismatch blocks a straightforward implementation following the specification.",

      "suggested_fix": "Align the constructor signatures between problem and solution. Either (A) update the solution to provide a two-argument constructor for LaunchedRollerCoaster (String name, char abbreviation) that calls super(name, abbreviation, <defaultNumberOfLoopings>) or add an overloaded RollerCoaster constructor that accepts only (String name, char abbreviation) so LaunchedRollerCoaster can call super(name, abbreviation). Or (B) update the problem statement and tasks to require the three-argument constructor (name, abbreviation, numberOfLoopings) if that was intended. Choose one of these so students have an unambiguous constructor signature to implement."
