In the solution implementation this method is declared as protected (protected int getTotalNumberOfStudents()), which is a visibility mismatch. This can confuse students about the intended visibility and may cause access problems when tests or other classes expect a public method.",

In the solution and (if present) any example implementations, change the method signature to `public int getTotalNumberOfStudents()` (and update any documentation/comments in the template to indicate the method should be public). If the intent was to keep it protected, update the UML and problem statement to show protected visibility instead and document why students should implement it as protected."
