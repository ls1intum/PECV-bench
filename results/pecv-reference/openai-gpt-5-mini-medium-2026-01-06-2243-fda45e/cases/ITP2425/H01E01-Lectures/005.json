      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares the attribute lectureName as type int (problem_statement.md UML lines 63\u201369), but the intended design and the solution use lectureName as a String (solution_repository/src/de/tum/cit/ase/Lecture.java lines 6\u201310) and the textual examples (e.g. the sample toString and the attribute list) imply a textual lecture name. This is an inner-cross artifact contradiction: the UML's type for lectureName conflicts with the rest of the specification and the solution. Students reading the UML could be misled to implement lectureName as an int, which will conflict with methods that expect a textual name (e.g., getNameAndTotalNumberOfStudents(), toString()).",
