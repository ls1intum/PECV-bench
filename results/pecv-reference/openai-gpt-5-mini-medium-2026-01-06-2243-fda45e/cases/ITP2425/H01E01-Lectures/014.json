This inconsistency between the problem UML and the solution (and likely expected student implementation) can confuse students about the correct types to use for student counts and whether they must handle fractional students or cast/convert types when implementing methods.",

Update the template Lecture.java to use the chosen types so students have a clear, consistent specification."

This creates an inner-artifact contradiction in the problem statement: summing double attributes but returning an int is unclear (should the sum be cast/truncated/rounded?). The solution uses int attributes and returns int, but the UML's mixed types could mislead students about constructor and method parameter/return types.",
