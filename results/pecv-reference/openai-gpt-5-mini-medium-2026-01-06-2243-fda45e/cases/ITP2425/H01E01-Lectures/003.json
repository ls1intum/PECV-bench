      "description": "The problem statement UML declares getTotalNumberOfStudents() to return a String, but the provided solution implements getTotalNumberOfStudents() to return an int. This is a structural return-type mismatch: if a student follows the UML and implements getTotalNumberOfStudents() as String, they will be unable to use its numeric result in later methods (e.g., getNumberOfStudentsPerTutor() which performs integer division). The problem text even tells students to \"check the expected return type in the UML diagram,\" which reinforces the incorrect UML and will likely confuse or block students when implementing subsequent tasks.",

Update the problem statement UML (and any textual guidance) so getTotalNumberOfStudents() is declared to return int instead of String. This preserves the intended design (numeric total used in getNumberOfStudentsPerTutor()) and avoids confusing students. Alternatively, if the exercise truly intended a String return, update the solution and other methods to operate on that String representation (less desirable)."
