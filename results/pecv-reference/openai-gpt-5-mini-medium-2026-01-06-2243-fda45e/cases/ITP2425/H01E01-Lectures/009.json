      "description": "The UML in the problem statement shows the lecture attributes as private (fields prefixed with '-') but the template repository declares two existing attributes as public (Lecture.java: lines 4-5). The solution implementation uses private fields. This visibility mismatch (public in the template vs. private in the UML/solution) can confuse students about the intended encapsulation and whether they should change the existing fields' visibility or add new private fields. It may also lead to inconsistent implementations or failing style checks if tests expect private fields/getters.",

Update template_repository/src/de/tum/cit/ase/Lecture.java so that lectureName and numberOfInscribedStudents are declared private (and add the remaining attributes also as private in the UML order). This aligns the template with the problem specification and the solution, avoiding student confusion about intended encapsulation."
