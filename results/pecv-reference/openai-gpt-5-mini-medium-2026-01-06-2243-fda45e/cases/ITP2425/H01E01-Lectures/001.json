      "description": "The solution's constructor is declared with package-private visibility (no access modifier) while the problem statement asks students to \"Create a constructor that initializes every attribute\" without specifying visibility. This creates a potential visibility mismatch: students will reasonably implement a public constructor (and tests or external code may expect to instantiate Lecture from outside the package). A package-private constructor in the solution/template can prevent instantiation from other packages (or from typical external test harnesses) and thus may cause confusion or test failures.",

This ensures students and external tests can instantiate the class without visibility issues."
