      "description": "The problem statement's UML and textual description specify numberOfInscribedStudents as an int, but the solution implementation declares it as a long. This is a structural type mismatch for a core attribute students will need to use when implementing getters, constructor parameters and methods that compute totals. The mismatch can confuse students about the expected type and, as implemented in the solution, leads to type incompatibilities when that attribute is used in methods expecting int values.",

The simplest fix preserving the UML and task hints is to change the solution's numberOfInscribedStudents from long to int and update the constructor parameter, getter, and setter signatures accordingly. Alternatively, if large values are intentionally required, update the problem statement UML and all method return types/usages to use long consistently (and ensure getTotalNumberOfStudents uses/returns long)."

      "description": "There is a mismatch between method return types/usages and the attribute type in the solution: the solution's getNumberOfInscribedStudents() returns a long (because the attribute is long) while the problem UML and tasks indicate total-related methods return int. In the solution getTotalNumberOfStudents() is declared to return int but computes numberOfGuestStudents + numberOfInscribedStudents where one operand is long \u2014 this produces a long value and will cause a compilation/type error or implicit narrowing if changed. This inconsistency between method return types and attribute types will confuse students and may prevent code from compiling.",
