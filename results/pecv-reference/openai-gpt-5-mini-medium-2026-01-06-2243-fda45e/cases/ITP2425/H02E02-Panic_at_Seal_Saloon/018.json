      "description": "The problem statement explicitly requires a non-static method checkOrderReady() on SealSaloon (and instructs orderMeal() to call checkOrderReady()). However, the reference solution implements a method named processOrders() that provides the expected behavior and is called by orderMeal(), while there is no checkOrderReady() implementation. This name/signature mismatch between the specification and the solution can confuse students (they will implement checkOrderReady() as required by the text/UML) and makes the solution inconsistent with the documented API.",
