The reference solution implements calculateRemainingOrderNumber() as a void method that prints lines (and does not return an integer). This is a direct signature/return-type mismatch that will confuse students about the expected API and how the method should be used (return value vs printing).",

Either: (A) change the reference implementation to declare public int calculateRemainingOrderNumber() and return the number of remaining orders (e.g., return this.orders.length), optionally printing if desired; or (B) update the problem statement/UML to require a void method that prints the order numbers. Prefer option (A) to match the current textual requirement that the method \"returns the number of remaining orders.\" Also ensure the template (and tests) use the same signature."

      "description": "Within the problem statement there is conflicting guidance for calculateRemainingOrderNumber(): the text explicitly says it should \"return the number of remaining orders as an integer\", but the adjacent example shows printed lines like \"Order number: 0\", which implies printing rather than returning. This internal contradiction can confuse students about whether they should return an int or produce console output.",

If the intended behavior is to print status lines, change the textual requirement to specify a void method that prints the order numbers. Make the wording and example consistent so students know the expected signature and behavior."
