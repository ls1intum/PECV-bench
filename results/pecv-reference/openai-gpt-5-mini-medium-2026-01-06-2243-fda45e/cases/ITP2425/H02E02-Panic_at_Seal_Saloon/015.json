Initializing a static field in the instance constructor conflicts with the static requirement and is ambiguous: should stock be an instance final field initialized in the constructor or a static field initialized elsewhere? The solution implements stock as a static final field initialized at declaration (private static final Stock stock = new Stock()).",
