      "description": "The problem statement gives conflicting instructions about the SealSaloon.stock attribute. One part instructs students to create a final (instance) Stock and initialize it in the SealSaloon constructor (instance initialization), while a later section explicitly requires the stock attribute to be static (shared across all instances). Initializing a static final field in an instance constructor is not appropriate and will confuse students about whether stock should be an instance or a static field and where it should be initialized.",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the problem statement consistent: decide whether stock is instance-final or static. If stock must be shared across all stores, state explicitly that it should be declared static (e.g. private static final Stock stock = new Stock();) and remove the instruction to initialize it in the instance constructor. If the intent is an instance field, remove the 'must be static' requirement. Update the UML and wording accordingly."

Preferably change the reference solution to match the UML/spec and return void to avoid confusing students implementing per the exercise text."
