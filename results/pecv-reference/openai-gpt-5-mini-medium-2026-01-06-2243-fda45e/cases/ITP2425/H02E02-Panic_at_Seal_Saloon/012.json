      "description": "The problem statement and UML refer to a class named 'Stock' (and instruct students to modify it / use a final Stock stock), but the template and solution repositories provide a fully implemented class named 'Inventory' that exposes the expected stock methods (add, take, findStockIngredient, addToStockIngredients, emptyStock). Meanwhile Stock.java in both template and solution is empty. This naming/type mismatch (Stock vs Inventory) is a structural inconsistency that will confuse students about which class they should use or modify and may block them from following the instructions that explicitly mention a 'Stock' class and a final Stock stock attribute.",

Two viable fixes:\n1) Rename the Inventory class to Stock (move its implementation into Stock.java and remove/replace the empty Stock.java), and update the problem statement/UML to reference Stock accordingly. Ensure SealSaloon and all references use `Stock`.\nOR\n2) Update the problem statement and UML to use the name Inventory instead of Stock, and remove the empty Stock.java file to avoid confusion. Ensure instructions that mention 'final Stock stock' and 'Stock' methods reflect `Inventory` as the shared stock type.\nEither option will align the template, solution, and problem description and prevent students from being blocked by the class-name/type mismatch."

      "description": "The problem statement and UML refer to a class named 'Stock' (and instruct students to work with a Stock attribute and Stock methods). However, the starter code provides a class named Inventory that implements the exact methods described for Stock (add, take, findStockIngredient, addToStockIngredients, emptyStock), and SealSaloon in the solution uses Inventory as the type for its shared stock attribute. Additionally, the Stock.java file in the template/solution is empty. This creates a naming mismatch between the exercise description (Stock) and the provided code (Inventory), likely confusing students who will look for a Stock class and Stock-typed attribute/methods as specified in the problem statement/UML.",
