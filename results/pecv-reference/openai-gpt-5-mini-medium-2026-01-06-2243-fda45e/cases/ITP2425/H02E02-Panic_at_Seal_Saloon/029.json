      "description": "Contradiction about the SealSaloon.stock field: one part of the problem text asks students to initialize the stock in the SealSaloon constructor (implying an instance final field), while a later explicit requirement states that the stock attribute must be static (shared across all instances). These statements conflict \u2014 a static final shared stock cannot be sensibly described as being initialized per-instance in the constructor. This ambiguity can confuse students about whether to declare stock as an instance final field (initialized in the constructor) or as a static (class) field, and may cause incorrect implementations or failing tests that expect a shared/static stock.",
