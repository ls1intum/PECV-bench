      "description": "The problem statement instructs students to initialize both SealSaloon attributes (orders and stock) to default values in the SealSaloon constructor (e.g., \"These should be initialized to default values ... in the constructor of SealSaloon\"), but also explicitly requires that the stock attribute be static (\"The following methods and attributes must be static: - stock attribute\"). Initializing a static final field in an instance constructor is incorrect (static final fields must be initialized at declaration or in a static initializer). This is a structural contradiction that will confuse students about where/how to create/initialize the shared stock.",

Update the text and UML accordingly so students have a single, consistent instruction for how to declare and initialize stock."
