      "description": "The Stock.take method's return type in the template repository differs from the type specified in the problem statement and the implementation in the solution. The problem UML (and the solution) expect take(String) to return an int (returning -1 to indicate failure), while the template's Stock.take is declared to return boolean and returns true/false. This mismatch is structural and will confuse or block students: they will implement SealSaloon and other logic according to the UML/spec (which uses integer semantics and -1 failure code) but the provided template API does not match, causing compile errors or incorrect behavior when students follow the problem description.",

This aligns template, problem statement, and solution and prevents student confusion (alternatively, if the intent was boolean, update the problem statement and solution to use boolean semantics consistently)."
