      "description": "The problem text instructs students to initialize the SealSaloon attributes (orders and a final Stock stock) in the instance constructor (lines ~70-71). Later the spec explicitly requires the stock attribute to be static (lines ~77-81). Initializing a static (and especially static final) field in an instance constructor is incorrect in Java and will confuse students: static final fields must be initialized at declaration or in a static initializer, not in an instance constructor. The contradiction (initialize in constructor vs. make the attribute static) is an unintentional structural inconsistency that can lead to compile errors or unclear implementation choices.",

Prefer option (B) to match the solution: state that stock is static (shared across instances) and should be initialized at declaration (e.g. private static final Stock stock = new Stock();) or in a static initializer block."
