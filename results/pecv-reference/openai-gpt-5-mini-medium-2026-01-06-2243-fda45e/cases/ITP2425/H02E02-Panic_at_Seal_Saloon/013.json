      "description": "The problem text instructs that the SealSaloon has a final Stock stock and that the attributes \"should be initialized to default values ... in the constructor of SealSaloon\" (problem_statement.md lines 70-71). However, the problem also requires the stock attribute to be static (problem_statement.md lines 77-81). Initializing a static final field in an instance constructor is incorrect in Java (static final must be initialized at declaration or in a static initializer). The solution implements stock as a static final field initialized at declaration (solution_repository/src/de/tum/cit/ase/SealSaloon.java lines 5-6), which is consistent with Java but contradicts the instruction to initialize it in the constructor. This conflicting instruction in the problem statement can confuse students about whether stock should be static and where it should be initialized.",

Either (a) remove the sentence that says the fields must be initialized in the constructor and state that the static final stock should be initialized at declaration or in a static initializer, or (b) make stock an instance (non-static) final field if you intend initialization in the instance constructor. Prefer (a) to keep the design where stock is shared (static final) across instances."

Alternatively, update the problem statement to document the extra parameter if that was intentional."

      "description": "The problem statement defines a no-argument method checkOrderReady(): void (UML and textual requirements). In the solution, the method is implemented as checkOrderReady(boolean enableLogging) (an extra parameter). This changes the expected method signature and can confuse students who will look for/implement checkOrderReady() exactly as specified in the exercise. The added boolean parameter appears to be an implementation detail (logging) and not part of the assignment API, so the mismatch creates unnecessary mapping overhead between the spec and the provided solution.",
