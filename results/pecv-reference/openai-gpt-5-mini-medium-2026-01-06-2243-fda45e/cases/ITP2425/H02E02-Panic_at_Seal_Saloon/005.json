      "description": "The problem statement requires a modifiable List<Meal> attribute called `orders` (explicitly stated in the text and implied by the UML), but the reference solution (and the provided helpers) use a plain Meal[] array for orders. This is a structural mismatch: students reading the spec will expect to use java.util.List<Meal>, but the template helpers (ArrayHelpers) and solution use arrays. This can confuse students about the expected data structure and which APIs to use (List vs. array).",

Make the expected type explicit and consistent across the statement, template, and solution."

      "description": "The problem text asks to initialize the required attributes (orders and stock) in the SealSaloon constructor, but it also mandates that the `stock` attribute must be static (and the UML/notes imply it should be final/read-only). Initializing a static final field in an instance constructor is incorrect in Java (static final must be initialized at declaration or in a static initializer). This is a conflicting instruction that can lead students to attempt an implementation that does not compile or to uncertainty about where to construct the shared stock.",

Ensure the problem statement and UML consistently reflect whether `stock` is a shared static resource or an instance field."
