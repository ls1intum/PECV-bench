      "description": "The problem statement explicitly requires calculateTotalPrice to be static (problem statement notes that stock, acceptSupplyDelivery and calculateTotalPrice must be static). However, in the provided solution calculateTotalPrice is implemented as an instance method (non-static). This mismatch between the specification and the reference implementation can confuse students about whether the method should be static and how they should access the shared stock (via class vs instance).",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the design consistent: either (A) change the solution and any example usages so calculateTotalPrice is declared static (public static int calculateTotalPrice(Meal meal)) and uses the static stock, or (B) update the problem statement to remove the requirement that calculateTotalPrice must be static and explain that it may be an instance method that uses the shared static stock. Prefer option A (make the method static) to match the stated intent that the method is related to the shared stock."
