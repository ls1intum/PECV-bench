      "description": "The problem statement requires a static method named acceptSupplyDelivery(String, int, int) (see UML and textual description). The reference solution instead provides a static method named receiveDelivery(String, int, int) in SealSaloon.java. This name mismatch between the specification and the solution is a structural inconsistency: tests, examples, and the textual requirements refer to acceptSupplyDelivery, so students (and automated tests) will expect that exact API. The solution having a different method name may confuse students comparing their work to the reference or cause the reference to fail tests that rely on the specified name.",

This difference between the UML (which omits the static marking) and the textual requirements can confuse students about whether those members should be static or instance-level.",
