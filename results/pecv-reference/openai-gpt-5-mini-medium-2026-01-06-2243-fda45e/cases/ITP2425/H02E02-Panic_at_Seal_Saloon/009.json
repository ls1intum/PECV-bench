      "description": "The problem statement and solution expect a class named Meal that is fully implemented (constructor Meal(String, String[]) and getters). The template repository, however, does not provide an implemented Meal class (Meal.java is empty) and instead contains an Order class with the same shape. This naming/availability mismatch will confuse students: the statement says Meal is provided, but the template doesn't include it and includes a differently-named class (Order). Students may be uncertain whether to implement Meal themselves or adapt to Order, and the provided Main in the template references Order in commented code while the problem text and solution use Meal.",

However, the template repository does not provide Meal.java and instead provides a class named Order with the same fields and methods (name, ingredients). This naming mismatch (Meal vs Order) creates a direct mapping barrier: students reading the problem will look for a Meal class in the template, may be confused by the presence of Order, and could either attempt to rename or duplicate types incorrectly. This is an unintentional identifier naming inconsistency rather than a purposeful pedagogical variation.",
