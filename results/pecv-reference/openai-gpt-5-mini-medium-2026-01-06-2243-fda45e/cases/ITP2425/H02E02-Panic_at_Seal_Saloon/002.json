      "description": "The problem text instructs students to initialize both attributes (orders and stock) in the SealSaloon constructor (no-arg constructor). Later the text requires the stock attribute to be static (and the solution implements it as a static final field initialized at declaration). This is contradictory because a static final field cannot be (re-)assigned in an instance constructor. Students following the instruction to initialize stock inside the constructor will either produce a compile error (if they try to assign a static final there) or violate the 'static' requirement. The solution correctly initializes the static final stock at declaration, but the problem statement wording could confuse students about where to initialize stock.",

      "suggested_fix": "Clarify the initialization instructions: state that orders should be initialized in the instance constructor, and that the shared stock must be declared static (and may be initialized at its declaration or in a static initializer). For example: 'Initialize orders to an empty array in the SealSaloon constructor. Declare stock as static (and initialize it at declaration or in a static initializer) since it is shared across instances.' This removes the contradiction about assigning a static/final field in an instance constructor."
