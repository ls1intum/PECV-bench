This inconsistent identifier for the same conceptual operation (adding a StockIngredient into the Stock) can confuse students: they will look for addToStockIngredients as shown in the diagram and in the solution, but the starter code exposes addItem instead. This mismatch may cause students to (a) spend time searching for the expected method, (b) accidentally implement a duplicate method, or (c) change the wrong place, introducing extraneous cognitive load unrelated to the exercise learning goals.",
