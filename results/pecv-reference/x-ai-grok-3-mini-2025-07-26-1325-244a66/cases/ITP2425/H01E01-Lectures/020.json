    {
      "description": "The method getNumberOfStudentsPerTutor() is described in the problem statement's UML diagram as returning an int, but the template repository suggests a double return type in a comment, and the solution repository implements it as returning a double. This discrepancy could confuse students about the expected return type, potentially leading them to implement it as int based on the UML, only to find it incompatible with the intended solution.",
