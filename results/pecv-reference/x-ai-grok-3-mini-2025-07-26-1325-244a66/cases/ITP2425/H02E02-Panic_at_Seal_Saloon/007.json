      "description": "The problem statement specifies a method named 'acceptSupplyDelivery' with parameters (String, int, int) in the SealSaloon class, as shown in the UML diagram. However, in the solution repository, this method is implemented as 'receiveDelivery' with the same parameters in SealSaloon.java. Additionally, the Main.java in the solution repository calls 'acceptSupplyDelivery', which does not exist, leading to a compilation error and confusion for students who are trying to understand the intended implementation based on the problem description and the provided solution.",
