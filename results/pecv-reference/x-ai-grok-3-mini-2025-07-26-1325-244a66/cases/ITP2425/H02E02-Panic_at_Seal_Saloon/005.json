    {
      "description": "The problem statement specifies that the 'orders' attribute in the SealSaloon class should be a modifiable List<Meal>, as indicated in the UML diagram and task description. However, in the solution repository, this attribute is implemented as a Meal[] array. This discrepancy could confuse students who follow the problem statement literally, especially since the template provides ArrayHelpers for array manipulation, potentially leading them to question whether they should use lists or arrays in their implementation.",
