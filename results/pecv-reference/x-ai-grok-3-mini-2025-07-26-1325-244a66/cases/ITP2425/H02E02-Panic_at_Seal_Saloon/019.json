      "description": "The problem statement specifies that the checkOrderReady() method in the SealSaloon class should return void, as indicated in the UML diagram. However, the solution implementation defines it as returning a boolean, which creates a contradiction between the expected design and the provided solution. This could confuse students who follow the problem statement, leading them to implement a void method, only to find it incompatible with the solution's structure.",
