      "description": "The problem statement specifies a method named checkOrderReady() in the SealSaloon class to handle order processing logic, but the solution repository implements this logic in a method named processOrders() instead, creating a contradiction between the specified design and the provided solution. This could confuse students who are expected to implement the method as described in the problem statement, leading them to question the correct method name and structure.",

      "description": "The problem statement specifies a method named 'checkOrderReady' in the SealSaloon class diagram, which is intended to process and serve orders. However, in the solution repository, this functionality is implemented as 'processOrders', creating a naming inconsistency that could confuse students by requiring them to map the problem's required method name to a different name in the solution code. This discrepancy hinders students' ability to connect the problem requirements directly to the implementation, increasing cognitive load during development and testing.",
