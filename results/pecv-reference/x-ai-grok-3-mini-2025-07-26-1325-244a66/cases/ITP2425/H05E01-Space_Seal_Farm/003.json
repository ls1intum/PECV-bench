      "description": "The Milkable interface is defined in the problem statement to have a method messageOnMilk() that returns a String, as per the specification for returning a message like '[Animal Type] [name] is milked'. However, in the solution repository, this method is implemented to return a boolean, creating a contradiction between the expected design and the provided solution code. This inconsistency could confuse students who refer to the solution as a reference, leading them to implement the wrong return type and deviate from the intended design.",
