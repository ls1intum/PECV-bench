      "description": "The problem statement specifies that the Farm class should have an attribute of type List<Animal> for the animals collection, as indicated in the UML diagram. However, the solution repository implements this attribute as a Set<Animal> in Farm.java. This discrepancy could confuse students who implement it as a List based on the problem statement, potentially leading to differences in behavior (e.g., ordering and duplicates), and might make the solution incompatible with student implementations if tests rely on Set semantics.",
