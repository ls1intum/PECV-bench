      "description": "The problem statement instructs to initialize the `stock` attribute in the `SealSaloon` constructor. However, the `stock` attribute is declared as `static final`. Static final fields must be initialized at declaration or in a static initializer block, not in an instance constructor. The solution correctly initializes it at declaration. This creates a conflict between the problem's instruction and the technical requirements for static final fields, potentially confusing students who try to follow the instruction literally.",
