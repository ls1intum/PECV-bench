The problem's UML and the template common model declare birthday as java.time.LocalDate (Client-side code like PersonScene and controller expect LocalDate), but the solution's common Person model uses String for the birthday. This is a structural type mismatch that will confuse students (and cause JSON mapping/usage differences) because the rest of the template and the problem text use LocalDate.",
