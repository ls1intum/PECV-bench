      "description": "The Person class constructor visibility differs between the template and the solution and conflicts with how Person is instantiated elsewhere in the code. In the template the no-arg constructor is public (allowing instantiation from other packages), while in the solution the constructor is package-private (no modifier). Client code (e.g. PersonScene and other client classes) instantiate Person with new Person(), which requires a public constructor. The package-private constructor in the solution therefore contradicts the usage in the client and would prevent or confuse instantiation across packages/modules.",
