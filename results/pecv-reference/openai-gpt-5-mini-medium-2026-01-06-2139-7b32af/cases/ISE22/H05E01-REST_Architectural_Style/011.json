      "description": "The solution's PersonScene view introduces a direct dependency on PersonService (an imported type and a private final personService field) that is not present in the template and contradicts the MVC layering described in the problem statement. Moreover, the solution declares the field as 'private final PersonService personService;' but does not initialize it in the constructor, which causes a compile-time error. This both violates the intended MVC separation (View should not access Service directly) and prevents the solution from compiling, which will confuse students when comparing template, problem description and solution.",

If direct access to the service was intentional (which would contradict the stated MVC architecture), either: (a) initialize the field via constructor injection and use it consistently (and update the problem statement to reflect the deviation from MVC), or (b) better: keep the view using only the PersonController (as in the template) and route all service interactions through the controller to preserve the MVC layering described in the assignment."
