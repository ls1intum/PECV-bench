      "description": "Visibility mismatch for PersonService methods between the template/problem description and the solution. The problem/template present PersonService methods as public (students will implement and call these from PersonResource). In the solution repository PersonService.savePerson, PersonService.deletePerson and PersonService.getAllPersons are declared protected. PersonResource (in the solution) calls these methods from a different package (de.tum.in.ase.eist.rest -> de.tum.in.ase.eist.service). Changing the service methods to protected breaks the expected visibility model, contradicts the problem note warning about not changing PersonService attributes, and may confuse students (and can prevent correct compilation/usage if those visibility changes are applied to the template).",

Concretely, change the protected declarations in the solution back to public (or move/copy PersonResource into the same package or expose a public interface). Also ensure the problem statement's note about not changing PersonService is clear (e.g., clarify that only field attributes must not be changed, not method visibility) to avoid confusion."
