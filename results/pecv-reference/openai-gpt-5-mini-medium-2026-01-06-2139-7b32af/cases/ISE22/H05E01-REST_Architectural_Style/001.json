      "description": "HTTP verb for creating persons is inconsistent between the problem statement and the provided solution. The problem statement explicitly requires POST /persons for creating a new Person (see problem statement lines describing endpoints). In the reference solution the create endpoint is implemented with @PutMapping(\"persons\") (server) and the client uses WebClient.put() when adding a person. This mismatch will confuse students: they will (reasonably) implement a POST endpoint and a client that uses POST as requested by the assignment, but the solution and provided reference tests expect a PUT-based create endpoint. This is a structural API contract mismatch that can prevent the student's implementation from matching the solution/tests.",

In the solution code both the server and client implement creation using HTTP PUT (server: PersonResource.createPerson is annotated with @PutMapping(\"persons\"); client: PersonController.addPerson uses WebClient.put()). This is an unintended semantic mismatch for the same conceptual operation (create person). Students following the problem/template instructions (expecting POST) will be confused when the provided solution uses PUT \u2014 the HTTP method differs for the same action, breaking a clear one-to-one mapping between requirement and implementation.",
