      "description": "The problem statement explicitly warns students not to change the attributes of PersonService. In the template repository PersonService declares the backing collection as a List<Person> (private final List<Person> persons;). In the solution repository PersonService, this attribute has been changed to a Set<Person> (private final Set<Person> persons;). This is an attribute-type mismatch across artifacts and contradicts the problem statement's instruction. Students comparing the reference solution to the template (or using the solution as a guide) may be confused about the intended field type and the admonition not to change attributes; it also undermines the clear instruction and may lead to inconsistent expectations about ordering/semantics of the collection.",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the solution repository consistent with the template and the problem statement by using the same collection type as the template (change the solution's PersonService.persons back to List<Person>). Alternatively, if using a Set is intentional, update the problem statement to remove or revise the warning about not changing PersonService attributes so students are not misled, and ensure the template matches the intended final design. Prefer keeping the template and solution aligned (both List or both Set) and reflect that choice in the problem text."
