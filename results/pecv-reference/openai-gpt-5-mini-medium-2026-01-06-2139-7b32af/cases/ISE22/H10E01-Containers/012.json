      "description": "The problem statement states that the `parents` attribute is a List that preserves insertion order, but both the template and the solution define `parents` (and `children`) as a Set<Person> (backed by HashSet). This is a structural/type mismatch: students following the problem text might change or implement the model using List semantics (insertion order, allowing duplicates) which will conflict with the provided entity mapping, repository usage, and the solution/tests that expect Set semantics (uniqueness, unordered).",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the representation consistent. The least disruptive fix is to update the problem statement to describe `parents` (and `children`) as a Set<Person> (or a generic Collection with uniqueness semantics) and remove the claim that it preserves insertion order. Alternatively, if insertion order is required pedagogically, change the template and solution model fields to use List<Person> (e.g., List<Person> parents = new ArrayList<>()) and update the tests and repository/entity mapping accordingly. Recommendation: update the problem statement to say Set to match the template/solution and tests."
