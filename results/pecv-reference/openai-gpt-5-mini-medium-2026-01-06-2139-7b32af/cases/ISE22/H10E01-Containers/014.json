However, both the template and solution Person classes declare the children field as private with a public getter (getChildren()). This is a visibility/usage mismatch and will confuse students: the instruction suggests a public field that does not exist in the provided code, and students following the text may try to access a non-existing public member or change visibility unnecessarily. The mismatch also conflicts with the solution/tests which use the getters.",
