      "description": "The problem statement's class diagram and descriptions indicate that acceptSupplyDelivery should be a public (\"+\") static method on SealSaloon (see UML: +acceptSupplyDelivery(String, int, int): void). In the solution, acceptSupplyDelivery is implemented as a package-private static method (no access modifier). This is a visibility mismatch: students reading the UML/description will expect a public API method (and the instructions also emphasize adding getters for private fields and following the diagram), while the solution uses a narrower visibility. This discrepancy may confuse students about the intended visibility and access level of the method and about whether it should be callable from other classes or tests.",

Declare the method as public static void acceptSupplyDelivery(String name, int price, int quantity) in SealSaloon (i.e., add the public modifier). Alternatively, if package-private visibility is intentional, update the problem statement/UML to show a non-public method to avoid confusion."
