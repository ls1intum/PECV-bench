      "description": "The problem statement explicitly requires calculateTotalPrice to be a static method (see the note listing which methods/attributes must be static). However, in the solution SealSaloon.calculateTotalPrice is implemented as an instance method (non-static). This mismatch between the specification and the provided solution can confuse students about whether the method should be static, and it may cause inconsistencies in expected usage (e.g., calling SealSaloon.calculateTotalPrice(...) vs. instance.calculateTotalPrice(...)) or in tests that expect a static method.",

Ensure the template (and any tests) also expect the static signature so students and the reference solution are consistent with the specification."
