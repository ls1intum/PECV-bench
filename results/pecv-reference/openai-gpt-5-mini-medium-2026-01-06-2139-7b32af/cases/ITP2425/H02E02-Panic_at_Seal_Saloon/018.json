The reference solution instead implements a method named processOrders() (and orderMeal() calls processOrders()). This name/signature mismatch between the specification and the solution (absence of checkOrderReady()) is a structural inconsistency that can confuse students about the required API and the exact method they must implement/call.",

This keeps the API consistent with the UML and problem description and avoids confusing students about which method they must implement/call."

In the solution repository the same functionality is implemented under the name processOrders() in SealSaloon.java. This is a same-concept/name mismatch: students reading the problem will search for or implement checkOrderReady(), but the reference implementation (and potentially tests) uses processOrders(), creating an unnecessary mapping burden and potential confusion about the required method name.",
