      "description": "The problem statement/UML declare checkOrderReady() as a void method (no return value). The reference solution implements checkOrderReady() returning a boolean (servedAny) instead of void.

Either (A) update the problem statement/UML to indicate checkOrderReady() returns a boolean (and document the meaning), or (B) change the solution to implement checkOrderReady() with a void return type (keeping the rest of the behavior identical). Prefer option B if the intent is only to print and serve orders without returning a status."

      "description": "The problem text instructs students to initialize both attributes (orders and stock) in the constructor (\"These should be initialized ... in the constructor of SealSaloon\"). However, the problem also requires that the stock attribute be static (shared across instances). Initializing a static shared stock in the instance constructor is inconsistent guidance. The reference solution declares and initializes stock as a static final field at declaration (private static final Stock stock = new Stock()). This creates ambiguity for students about whether stock should be an instance-final field initialized in the constructor or a static (possibly static final) field initialized in a static context.",

Alternatively, if the intent is per-instance stock, remove the \"static\" requirement. Make the instruction and any example code consistent with the chosen design."
