      "description": "The problem statement and UML refer to a Meal class (Meal(String, String[]) with getters), and the solution implements Meal.java accordingly, but the template repository does not provide a Meal class. Instead the template contains an Order.java with the same constructor signature and getters. Additionally, template's Meal.java file is empty. This mismatch (class name/type missing in the template) will confuse students about which class to implement and can prevent compilation of students' code or tests that expect a Meal class.",

This creates a direct naming mismatch: students reading the problem expect a Meal class to be present/implemented, but the starter code exposes an Order class with the same shape (name, ingredients). The inconsistency forces students to mentally map 'Meal' \u2194 'Order' (or to rename files/classes), increasing extraneous cognitive load and risking confusion when following instructions and tests that refer to Meal.",
