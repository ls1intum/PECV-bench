      "description": "The problem statement explicitly asks for a modifiable List<Meal> attribute called `orders` (text and UML), but the provided solution implements `orders` as a Meal[] array and the template helper utilities (ArrayHelpers) are array-oriented. This mismatch between the specified type (List) and the concrete type used in solution/template (array) can confuse students about whether to use java.util.List (e.g., ArrayList) or plain arrays and which supporting utilities/APIs to use. It may also lead to students implementing a List-based solution while tests or supplied helpers expect array-based behavior, or vice versa.",

Ensure tests and example code align with the chosen representation so students know which collection type to use."

      "description": "The problem statement instructs that the `stock` and `orders` attributes should be initialized to default values in the SealSaloon constructor (constructor takes no parameters), but elsewhere in the same problem text it requires the `stock` attribute to be static (shared across instances). These two requirements conflict: initializing a static field per-instance in the constructor is incorrect/ambiguous. The solution initializes `stock` as a static final field at declaration. This contradiction in the problem description can mislead students about where/how to declare and initialize `stock` (static class-level vs. instance-level initialization).",

Alternatively, if `stock` is intended to be per-instance, remove the requirement that it be static. Update the UML and the explanatory instructions to consistently reflect the chosen design so students are not led to simultaneously implement contradictory initialization patterns."
