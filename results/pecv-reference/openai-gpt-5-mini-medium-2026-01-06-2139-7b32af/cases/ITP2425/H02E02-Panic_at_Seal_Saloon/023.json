      "description": "The problem description instructs students to initialize SealSaloon attributes (orders and stock) in the constructor (constructor takes no parameters) but also states that the stock attribute must be static (shared across all instances). Initializing a static (and especially a static final) field in an instance constructor is incorrect: static final fields must be initialized at declaration or in a static initializer, and assigning to a static final in an instance constructor will not compile. The solution resolves this by declaring and initializing stock as a static final field at declaration, which conflicts with the phrasing in the problem text and would confuse students about where/how to initialize stock.",

Update the problem text to explicitly state the chosen approach (e.g., \"stock must be declared static final and initialized at declaration or in a static initializer, not in the instance constructor\")."
