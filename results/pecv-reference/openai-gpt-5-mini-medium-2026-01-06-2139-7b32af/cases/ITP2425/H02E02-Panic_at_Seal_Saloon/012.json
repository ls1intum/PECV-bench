      "description": "The problem statement and UML refer to a class named Stock (with methods add, take, findStockIngredient, addToStockIngredients, emptyStock) and show SealSaloon holding a Stock. However, the provided template (and the solution) implement this functionality in a class named Inventory (Inventory.java) while Stock.java is empty. SealSaloon in the solution uses an Inventory-typed static field. This class-name/type mismatch between the specification (Stock) and the template/solution (Inventory) is structural: students reading the problem will expect to find/modify Stock, but the working implementation is in Inventory, which can cause confusion about where to implement or modify stock-related behavior and which type to reference in SealSaloon.",

      "description": "The problem statement and UML refer to the central stock class as \"Stock\" (including method signatures like add, take, findStockIngredient, addToStockIngredients, emptyStock and explicit instructions that the saloon has a final Stock stock). The template and solution repositories instead provide this functionality in a class named Inventory (Inventory.java) and the SealSaloon implementation uses Inventory as the type of the shared stock. An empty Stock.java file is present in the repositories, increasing the risk of confusion. This naming mismatch (Stock vs Inventory) makes it harder for students to map the problem description / UML to the provided code and to the expected solution: students may look for a Stock class with the described methods and either fail to find it or be uncertain whether Inventory is the intended implementation.",
