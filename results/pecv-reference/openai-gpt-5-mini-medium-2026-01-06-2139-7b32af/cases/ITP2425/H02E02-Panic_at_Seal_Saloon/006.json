The problem statement (class diagram) declares addToStockIngredients(StockIngredient) and the solution implements addToStockIngredients(...), but the template's Stock class exposes the method addItem(StockIngredient) instead. This creates a mapping barrier: students reading the problem diagram expect addToStockIngredients, the template code (what they start from) only provides addItem, and the solution uses addToStockIngredients when demonstrating acceptSupplyDelivery. Students may be confused which method to call when implementing SealSaloon.acceptSupplyDelivery, or encounter compile errors if they follow one artifact while referencing another.",
