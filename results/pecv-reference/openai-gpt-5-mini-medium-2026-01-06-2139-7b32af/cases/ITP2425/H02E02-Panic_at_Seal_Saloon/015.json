      "description": "The problem statement's UML shows SealSaloon.orderMeal(Meal): void (and the textual description refers to orderMeal as a procedure that adds the meal and calls checkOrderReady()). The solution implementation declares orderMeal(Meal) returning boolean (it returns true/false). This is a signature mismatch: students expecting a void method (per the UML/spec) will find a different return type in the reference solution, which may confuse them about the intended API and unit test expectations.",

Either (A) change the reference solution's orderMeal to return void (and omit the boolean return), matching the UML and textual description; or (B) update the problem statement/UML to indicate a boolean return and explain its meaning.

This is inconsistent: a static final field is typically initialized at declaration or in a static initializer, not per-instance in an instance constructor. The ambiguity could confuse students about where/how to initialize the static final stock and may lead to incorrect attempts to assign a final static field in the instance constructor.",

      "suggested_fix": "Clarify the initialization instructions. Either (A) state that only the instance attribute (orders) must be initialized in the instance constructor and that the static final stock should be initialized at its declaration or in a static initializer; or (B) remove the 'final' or 'static' requirement if the intent is to initialize stock in the instance constructor. Recommended fix: keep stock as static final (shared across instances) and update the text to say: \"Initialize orders in the no-arg constructor. Initialize the static final stock at declaration or in a static initializer.\" This removes the contradiction and prevents students from trying to assign a final static field in the constructor."
