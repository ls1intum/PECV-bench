      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares the SealSaloon attribute totalOrders as an int (\"-totalOrders: int\"), while the reference solution implements it as a long (private long totalOrders). This is a type mismatch in the expected attribute type. Although this does not block functionality, it is an unintentional structural inconsistency that can confuse students about the intended type for the order counter (int vs long).",

Prefer documenting which is intended (e.g., \"totalOrders: int\" in UML and use int in implementation) to avoid student confusion."
