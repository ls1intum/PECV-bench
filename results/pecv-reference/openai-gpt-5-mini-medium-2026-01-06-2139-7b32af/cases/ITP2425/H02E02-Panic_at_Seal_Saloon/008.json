The reference solution implements calculateRemainingOrderNumber() as a void method that prints order numbers instead of returning the integer. This is a structural mismatch in the method signature/return type and will confuse students about the expected API and what to implement or test against.",

If printing is desired for demonstration, keep printing but still return the integer so the API matches the problem statement and tests can rely on the return value."

This wording can confuse students whether stock should be an instance final field or a static (class) field. The reference solution uses a static final stock, but the mixed wording in the problem statement is ambiguous.",
