      "description": "The problem statement explicitly requires that \"Every class/interface has to be declared public\" (problem_statement.md line 5). In the solution, the Pneumatic interface is declared without the public modifier (solution_repository/src/de/tum/in/ase/Pneumatic.java lines 1-9: \"interface Pneumatic { ... }\"). This makes the interface package-private instead of public, which contradicts the exercise requirement and may confuse students about the required visibility and cause visibility-related test or compilation issues when other code expects a public interface.",
