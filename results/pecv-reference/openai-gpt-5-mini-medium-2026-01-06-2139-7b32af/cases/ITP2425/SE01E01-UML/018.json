      "description": "The problem statement and UML refer to a class named \"ExcellencePark\" (UML lines and task descriptions), while the exercise title, template repository, and solution repository use the name \"ExcellenceLand\". This inner-problem inconsistency (UML vs. textual tasks) combined with the cross-artifact name mismatch (problem text asks for ExcellencePark but the template/solution provide ExcellenceLand) will confuse students about which class to implement and what the tests expect. It may cause failing tests or incorrect implementations because constructors/getters and the 'rides' attribute are associated with a differently named class across artifacts.",
