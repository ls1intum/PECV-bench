      "description": "The problem statement's UML declares a Pneumatic interface with methods raisePressure(int) and openValve(), but the solution repository's Pneumatic interface declares raisePressure(int) and releasePressure() (no openValve). Meanwhile the solution's LaunchedDropdownTower and LaunchedRollerCoaster classes implement Pneumatic but provide openValve() (not releasePressure). This creates a structural mismatch across artifacts: the UML (and intended exercise) expects openValve(), the solution's interface uses releasePressure(), and the solution classes use openValve(), which makes the solution internally inconsistent and would not compile. Students following the UML will declare openValve(), which will not match the solution's Pneumatic; conversely, using the solution interface as given will not match the Launched* classes.",

Option A is simplest here because the UML explicitly specifies openValve()."

      "description": "The UML/problem statement defines the Pneumatic interface with methods raisePressure(int) and openValve(). In the solution repository the Pneumatic interface declares raisePressure(int) and releasePressure(), while the concrete classes (LaunchedRollerCoaster and LaunchedDropdownTower) override openValve(). This creates a naming mismatch: the problem expects an openValve() method but the solution interface uses releasePressure(). The inconsistency will confuse students mapping the UML to the code and also leads to an internal mismatch in the solution (implementing classes use openValve but the interface declares releasePressure), which can cause compilation errors or uncertainty about the correct method name to implement.",
