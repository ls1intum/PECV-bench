      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares Ride attributes with protected visibility (#name: String, #abbreviation: char) while the solution declares these attributes as private. This is a visibility mismatch: the UML indicates subclasses may access these attributes directly, but the solution uses private fields (accessible only via getters). Students reading the UML may expect to use protected fields in subclasses (e.g., access name/abbreviation directly in RollerCoaster or LaunchedDropdownTower), which can cause confusion about the intended visibility and how subclasses should be implemented.",

Either (a) change the UML in the problem statement to use private visibility (replace '#' with '-' for Ride attributes) to reflect the solution's private fields and encourage access via getters, or (b) change the implementation/template to declare Ride attributes as protected so they match the UML. Also update any guidance in the text to state the chosen attribute visibility explicitly to avoid confusion."
