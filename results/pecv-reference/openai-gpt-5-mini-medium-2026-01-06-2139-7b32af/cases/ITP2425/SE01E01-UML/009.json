      "description": "The problem statement contains conflicting instructions about the constructor parameters for LaunchedRollerCoaster. The general rule (line 5 of the problem statement) requires a public constructor for each class that takes all attributes defined in the UML as parameters. The UML/RollerCoaster class defines numberOfLoopings as an attribute, so a concrete subclass constructor normally needs to accept and forward that value. However, a later specific task (lines 63-65) states: \"The constructor of `LaunchedRollerCoaster` must only accept `name` and `abbreviation` as parameters.\" The provided solution implements LaunchedRollerCoaster with a constructor that accepts (String name, char abbreviation, int numberOfLoopings), which matches the UML and the general constructor rule but contradicts the special-case sentence in the task. This inconsistency can confuse students about the expected constructor signature and whether numberOfLoopings must be passed when instantiating LaunchedRollerCoaster.",

Either (A) remove or correct the special-case sentence in the task so it requires LaunchedRollerCoaster to accept (name, abbreviation, numberOfLoopings) \u2014 aligning the task with the UML and the solution \u2014 or (B) if the intent is that LaunchedRollerCoaster should only accept name and abbreviation, update the UML and the general constructor rule to explain how numberOfLoopings will be set (e.g., default value or setter) and update the solution/template to provide a matching constructor and necessary handling for numberOfLoopings. Option A (align task with UML/solution) is the simplest fix."
