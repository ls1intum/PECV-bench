      "description": "The problem statement (UML) specifies addGuestStudents(int) as returning void, and the task text does not indicate a return value. However, the solution implementation defines addGuestStudents(int) with a boolean return type (returns true/false). This is a signature mismatch: students implementing the method as described in the specification (void) will produce a different API than the provided solution, and automated tests or reference usage may expect the void signature. This inconsistency can confuse students about the intended contract of the method and cause integration or grading mismatches.",

Either (A) change the solution to match the UML and task text by making the method void addGuestStudents(int numberOfNewGuestStudents) and update its implementation to simply add the guests (optionally throwing or ignoring negative input), or (B) update the problem statement and UML to declare addGuestStudents(int): boolean and document the return semantics (e.g., returns true if guests were added, false otherwise). Also update the template to include the chosen signature so students implement the correct contract."
