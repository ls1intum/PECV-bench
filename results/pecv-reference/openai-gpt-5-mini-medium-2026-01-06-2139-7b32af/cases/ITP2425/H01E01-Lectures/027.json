      "description": "The problem statement and UML specify that the lectureName attribute is a String, but the solution repository changes the attribute type to a custom LectureName class. This is a cross-artifact attribute type mismatch that also changes the constructor parameter type: the solution's Lecture field is declared as LectureName and its constructor accepts LectureName, while the exercise expects a String lectureName (per UML and task text). This discrepancy will confuse students about the expected type and constructor signature and prevents straightforward implementation following the UML/specification.",

The solution repository, however, replaces this straightforward String with a new wrapper class LectureName and declares the Lecture.lectureName field as type LectureName. This introduces a new identifier (the LectureName class) and a type-level abstraction that is not present or mentioned in the problem statement or the template. Additionally, the solution's getter/setter signatures for lectureName use String while the field is declared as LectureName, creating an internal inconsistency in the solution. Together these differences (1) break the simple one-to-one mapping the problem expects between the conceptual attribute lectureName and an actual String field, (2) add an unexpected abstraction that students must understand or reconcile, and (3) may cause confusion or compile errors when students compare the problem, template, and solution.",
