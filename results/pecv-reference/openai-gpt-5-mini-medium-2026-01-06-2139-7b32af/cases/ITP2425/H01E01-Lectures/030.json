      "description": "The solution implementation of Lecture.java declares attributes using snake_case names (lecture_name, number_of_inscribed_students, number_of_guest_students, number_of_lecturers, number_of_tutors) but the constructor, getters, setters and other methods refer to camelCase names (lectureName, numberOfInscribedStudents, numberOfGuestStudents, numberOfLecturers, numberOfTutors). This mismatch between declared field names and the names used elsewhere in the same class will cause compilation errors and prevents the solution from reflecting the attribute names shown in the problem statement/UML. Students reading the solution (or trying to follow it) will be confused and will not be able to compile or use the solution as a reference.",
