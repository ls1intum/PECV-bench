      "description": "The UML in the problem statement shows the Lecture attributes as private (minus sign) and the solution defines all attributes as private, but the template file declares two attributes (lectureName and numberOfInscribedStudents) as public. This visibility mismatch can confuse students: the UML and tasks expect private attributes with getters/setters, yet the template exposes fields as public which may lead students to omit implementing proper encapsulation or be uncertain whether to add private fields or use the existing public ones.",
