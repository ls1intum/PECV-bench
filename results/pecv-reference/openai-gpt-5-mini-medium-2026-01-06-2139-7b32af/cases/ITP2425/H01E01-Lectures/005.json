      "description": "The UML in the problem statement declares lectureName as type int, but the textual description, example usages (toString and getNameAndTotalNumberOfStudents) and the solution implementation treat lectureName as a String. This contradiction between the UML and the rest of the materials can confuse students about the correct data type for lectureName and lead to an incorrect implementation (e.g., implementing lectureName as int, which would prevent concatenation and name-based outputs).",

Ensure the UML, textual description, and examples consistently indicate lectureName is a String. This preserves the intended design (name manipulations and concatenation in methods like toString and getNameAndTotalNumberOfStudents) and removes confusion for students."
