    {
      "description": "The solution implementation declares two getter methods as private (getLectureName() and getNumberOfInscribedStudents()) while the problem statement explicitly asks students to implement public getters for each attribute. The tests referenced in the problem (getLectureNameTest, getNumberOfInscribedStudentsTest, etc.) and the task description expect public access to these getters. Making these getters private in the solution contradicts the specification and would prevent external code (including test harnesses) from accessing these values and from matching the intended API.",
