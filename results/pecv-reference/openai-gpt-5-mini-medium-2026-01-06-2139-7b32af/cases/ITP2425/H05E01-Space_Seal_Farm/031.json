    {
      "description": "Visibility mismatch for Animal's constructor and name accessor methods: the problem statement (UML and explicit note) requires the Animal constructor and the getName()/setName() accessor methods to use protected visibility (UML shows '#' and the text explicitly requests protected getters/setters), but the solution implementation declares the Animal constructor and both accessor methods as public. This contradicts the specified encapsulation in the exercise and may confuse students about the required visibility for these members.",
