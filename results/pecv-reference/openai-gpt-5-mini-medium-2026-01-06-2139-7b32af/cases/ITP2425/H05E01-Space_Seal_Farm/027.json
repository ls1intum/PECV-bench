      "description": "Visibility inconsistency for the helper method singFarmSongVerse(Animal): the problem text explicitly instructs students to implement singFarmSongVerse(Animal animal) as public for easier testing, but the UML in the problem statement marks the method as private (minus sign) and both the template (Farm.java) and the solution (Farm.java) declare it private. This contradiction (text vs UML and code) will confuse students about the intended visibility and may break tests that expect a public helper method (or require students to make it public).",

      "suggested_fix": "Resolve the contradiction by choosing one canonical visibility and applying it consistently: either (A) update the problem statement UML to show singFarmSongVerse as public (preferred because the textual instruction requests public for testing) and change the method declarations in the template and solution to 'public void singFarmSongVerse(Animal animal)' (exposing the parameter as well), or (B) if the method should remain private, update the problem text to remove the instruction requiring it to be public and adjust test expectations. Prefer option A so the helper is accessible to tests and matches the problem text."
