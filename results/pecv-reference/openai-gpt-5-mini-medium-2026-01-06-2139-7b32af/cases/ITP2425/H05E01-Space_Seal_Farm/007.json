      "description": "The UML in the problem statement shows messageOnFeed() as a public abstract method (+ messageOnFeed():String) but the solution declares it as protected (protected abstract String messageOnFeed()). This is a visibility mismatch: the specification implies a public abstract contract while the solution narrows the declaration to protected. Students reading the UML or tests that expect a public method may be confused about the required visibility and signature.",

Change the declaration in Animal.java from 'protected abstract String messageOnFeed();' to 'public abstract String messageOnFeed();'. Ensure all concrete subclasses continue to implement this method (they may remain public). Alternatively, update the problem statement/UML to indicate the method should be protected if that was the intentional design."
