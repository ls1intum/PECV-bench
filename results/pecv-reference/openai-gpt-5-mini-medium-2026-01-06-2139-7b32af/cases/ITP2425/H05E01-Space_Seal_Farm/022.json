      "description": "The UML in the problem statement and the template implementation declare singFarmSongVerse as a private Farm method, but the solution repository implements it as protected (solution: protected void singFarmSongVerse(Animal)). This is a visibility mismatch between the specification/template and the reference solution. While this does not change behavior, it is a structural inconsistency that could confuse students about the intended visibility (and could matter if tests or extensions rely on the method being private).",

Either change the solution method to private (private void singFarmSongVerse(Animal animal)) to match the UML/template, or update the UML/template to indicate protected visibility. Prefer making the solution method private if the verse method is intended as an internal helper; otherwise update the UML and template comments to show protected."
