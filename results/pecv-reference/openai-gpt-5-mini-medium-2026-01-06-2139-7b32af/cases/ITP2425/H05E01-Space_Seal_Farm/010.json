      "description": "The UML in the problem statement defines Farm.animals as a private attribute (\"- animals: List<Animal>\") and the instructions explicitly ask for a getter and setter. In the solution repository, Farm declares the animals field as public (public List<Animal> animals;). This visibility mismatch contradicts the encapsulation indicated by the UML and the textual instructions and may confuse students about whether they should implement/use a private field with accessor methods or a public field.",
