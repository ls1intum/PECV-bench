      "description": "The problem statement and template refer to a Rideable interface (method messageOnRide()), but the solution repository uses an interface named Mountable for the ride functionality and leaves Rideable.java empty. This is a cross-artifact type/name mismatch: students reading the solution will see Mountable used in Pig and Seal while the exercise and template expect Rideable. The empty Rideable.java in the solution further increases confusion and prevents a straightforward mapping between the specification and the reference implementation.",

Also ensure Rideable.java in the solution is a proper interface declaration with the method signature `String messageOnRide();` (or have Rideable extend/alias Mountable) so students can map the specification to the reference implementation without confusion."

The solution repository, however, defines and uses an interface named 'Mountable' (Mountable.java) and has Pig and Seal implement Mountable; the Rideable.java in the solution is effectively absent/unused. This is a naming mismatch for the same conceptual entity (interface for animals that can be ridden) and will confuse students mapping the exercise requirements (Rideable) to the provided solution (Mountable). It may also cause their code (or tests) that reference Rideable to fail against the solution's implementation.",
