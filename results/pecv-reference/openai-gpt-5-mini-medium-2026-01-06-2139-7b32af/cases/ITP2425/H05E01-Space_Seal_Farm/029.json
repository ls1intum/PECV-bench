      "description": "The problem text explicitly instructs students to use StringBuilder for the Animal.name attribute for performance reasons, but the UML shown in the problem statement lists the attribute as name: String and the reference solution implements the attribute as a String (private String name). This contradiction (StringBuilder vs String) is structural: it affects the attribute type students must declare and the signatures of the getter/setter. Because the problem statement emphasizes the use of StringBuilder as \"Important\", students may be confused whether to implement the attribute as StringBuilder (as described in the prose) or as String (as shown in the UML and solution).",

Either (A) update the problem statement (and UML) to require a String name (remove the StringBuilder instruction) if examples/tests expect a String, or (B) update the UML and the solution/template to use StringBuilder for the Animal.name attribute and adjust the getter/setter signatures and any code that uses getName() accordingly (e.g., return type StringBuilder or provide a toString-based getter). Ensure the problem text and UML match exactly so students know which type to implement."
