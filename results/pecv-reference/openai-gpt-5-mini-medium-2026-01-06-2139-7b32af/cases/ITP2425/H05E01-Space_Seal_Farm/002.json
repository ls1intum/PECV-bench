      "description": "Constructor / attribute mismatch for Animal: the UML in the problem statement declares Animal with two attributes (name: String and age: int) and a constructor Animal(String, int) (problem_statement.md shows this in the UML). However, both the provided template Main (which constructs Seal/Pig/Goat with a single String argument) and the solution's Animal.java implement a single-argument constructor Animal(String) and no age attribute. This inconsistency will confuse students about the required constructor signature and whether an age attribute must be present.",
