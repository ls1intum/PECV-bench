      "description": "The problem specification / UML defines Animal.name as type String (private attribute), but the reference solution declares the attribute as a StringBuilder (private StringBuilder name). This is a structural type mismatch for a core attribute (the animal's name). Students reading the UML and instructions will expect to implement name as a String; the solution using StringBuilder is an unexpected deviation and could confuse students or cause surprises if they compare implementations or rely on reflection/field type checks.",

Update the solution (and any provided examples) to declare 'private String name;' and adjust the constructor, getter and setter to use and return String. Alternatively, if StringBuilder was intentional, update the problem statement/UML to indicate name: StringBuilder and justify why a mutable type is required."
