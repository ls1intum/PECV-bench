      "description": "The problem statement requires Farm to hold its animals in a List implemented as an ArrayList and to initialize that ArrayList in the no-arg constructor. The solution implementation instead uses a Set (HashSet) for the animals attribute and initializes a HashSet in the constructor. This is a structural mismatch: tests or student expectations that rely on a List/ArrayList (including guaranteed ordering and the explicit requirement in the task description) will not align with the solution's Set. Using a Set also changes ordering semantics for methods that iterate over animals (e.g., singFarmSong and feedAllAnimals), which can lead to failing tests or confusion about expected output order.",

      "suggested_fix": "Make the Farm implementation consistent with the problem description: change the animals field type to List<Animal>, import java.util.List and java.util.ArrayList, and initialize animals = new ArrayList<>(); in the no-arg constructor. Ensure getters/setters use List<Animal> and preserve iteration order when singing/feeding. Alternatively (less recommended), update the problem statement to allow Set semantics and remove the explicit ArrayList requirement \u2014 but keeping the problem text and tests consistent with a List/ArrayList is preferable."
