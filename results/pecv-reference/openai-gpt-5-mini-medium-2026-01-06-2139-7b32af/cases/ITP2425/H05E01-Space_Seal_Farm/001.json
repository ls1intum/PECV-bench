      "description": "The return type of messageOnMilk() is inconsistent between the problem statement (UML and textual description) and the provided solution. In the problem-document UML (and explicit textual instruction) messageOnMilk() is shown/said to return a boolean (true/false) indicating whether milking was successful. Elsewhere in the same UML the animal classes (Seal, Goat) show messageOnMilk():String, and the solution implements Milkable.messageOnMilk() as returning String (e.g., \"Goat [name] is milked\") with Seal/Goat returning Strings. This mismatch (boolean vs String) is an unintentional structural contradiction that will confuse students about the correct method signature to implement and what tests will expect.",

      "suggested_fix": "Unify the specification and examples so messageOnMilk() has a single return type. Two options (choose one):\n\n1) Prefer String (aligns with the solution and Main usage): update the problem statement UML and textual description to declare messageOnMilk():String and change the textual guidance (currently saying true/false) to describe returning a descriptive String (e.g., \"Goat [name] is milked\"). This matches the solution and the example printing of messageOnMilk().\n\n2) Prefer boolean (if that was intended): change the solution and example code to use boolean messageOnMilk(), update Milkable.java and implementations to return true/false, and adjust Main and any printed output accordingly. \n\nRecommendation: adopt option (1) because the solution and example usage already use and print Strings; update the UML (line showing boolean) and the textual instruction that currently says \"should return true/false\" to describe returning a String message instead."
