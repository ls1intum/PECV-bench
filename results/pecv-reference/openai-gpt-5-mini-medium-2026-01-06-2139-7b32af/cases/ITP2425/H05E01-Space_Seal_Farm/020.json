      "description": "The problem statement requires the Farm to hold its animals in a List and explicitly instructs to initialize an ArrayList in the no-argument constructor (problem_statement.md). The reference solution instead declares the animals collection as a Queue<Animal> and initializes it with a LinkedList (solution_repository/src/de/tum/cit/ase/Farm.java). This is a structural type mismatch for the core Farm attribute and its getter/setter signatures: the problem expects a List/ArrayList, the solution uses Queue/LinkedList. Students following the problem text (or tests that expect List) could be confused or may implement a different API than the solution demonstrates, and automated tests that expect a List type could fail against the solution's structure.",

Concretely, replace Queue<Animal> animals and LinkedList initialization with List<Animal> animals = new ArrayList<>(); update imports accordingly. Alternatively, if Queue semantics were intended, update the problem statement to explicitly allow Queue/LinkedList and change the UML/instructions to match."
