      "description": "The problem statement explicitly instructs students to \"Initialize the ArrayList in a constructor with no arguments\" for Farm and the sample Main (in the template) constructs a Farm with no arguments (new Farm()). However, the solution implementation of Farm provides only a single constructor with an int parameter (public Farm(int initialCapacity)) and does not provide a no-argument constructor. This mismatch means the solution does not match the stated API/usage in the problem and template: code that expects new Farm() (and the instruction to initialize the list in a no-arg constructor) would fail to compile against the provided solution, and students will be confused about which constructor to implement.",
