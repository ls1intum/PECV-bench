      "description": "In the solution repository, the getters for 'lectureName' and 'numberOfInscribedStudents' are declared as private, while the problem statement implies that getters for attributes should be publicly accessible for testing and standard usage, as seen in the UML diagram for other methods. This creates a visibility mismatch that could confuse students about the intended accessibility of their implemented getters, potentially leading to issues when testing in the Main class.",
