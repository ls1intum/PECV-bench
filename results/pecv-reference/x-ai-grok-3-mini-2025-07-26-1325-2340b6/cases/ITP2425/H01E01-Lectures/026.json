      "description": "The method getTotalNumberOfStudents() in the solution repository returns a StudentCount object, which contradicts the problem statement and UML diagram that specify it should return an int. This inconsistency could confuse students who are instructed to implement a method returning an integer, potentially leading them to question the required design or introduce unnecessary complexity by creating additional classes not mentioned in the problem.",
