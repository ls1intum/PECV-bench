      "description": "The method getNumberOfStudentsPerTutor() in the solution repository is declared to return a double, which conflicts with the problem statement's UML diagram that specifies it should return an int. This discrepancy could confuse students who refer to the UML for guidance while implementing based on the template, leading them to question the intended return type and potentially implement an incorrect design.",
