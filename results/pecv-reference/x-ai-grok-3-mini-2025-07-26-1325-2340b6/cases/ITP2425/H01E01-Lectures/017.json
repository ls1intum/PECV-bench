    {
      "description": "The method getTotalNumberOfStudents() is declared as protected in the solution repository, but the problem statement's UML diagram specifies it as public. This discrepancy could confuse students who follow the UML diagram and implement it as public, potentially leading to mismatches in grading or testing if the solution is used as a reference.",
