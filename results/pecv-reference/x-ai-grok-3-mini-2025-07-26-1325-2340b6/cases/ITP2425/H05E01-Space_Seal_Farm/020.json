      "description": "The problem statement specifies that the Farm class should use a List<Animal> attribute, implemented with an ArrayList, to manage animals. However, the solution repository implements this as a Queue<Animal> using a LinkedList, which introduces a type mismatch that could confuse students about the required data structure for the aggregation, potentially leading them to question the intended design principles of using Lists as described.",

      "description": "The addAnimal method in the problem statement uses the parameter name 'animal', while in the solution repository, it uses 'a'. This discrepancy in parameter naming for the same conceptual entity (the animal to be added to the farm) may create minor confusion for students, as they might assume parameter names are significant and need to match exactly, leading to unnecessary cognitive effort in mapping requirements to implementation.",
