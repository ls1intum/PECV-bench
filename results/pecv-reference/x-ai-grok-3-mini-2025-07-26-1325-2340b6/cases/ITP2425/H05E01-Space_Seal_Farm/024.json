      "description": "The problem statement contains an internal contradiction regarding the data type of the 'animals' attribute in the Farm class. The UML diagram specifies it as a List<Animal>, while the task description explicitly states that it should be a Set implemented using a HashSet to ensure unique animals. This inconsistency could confuse students about whether to use a List or a Set, potentially leading to incorrect implementations.",
