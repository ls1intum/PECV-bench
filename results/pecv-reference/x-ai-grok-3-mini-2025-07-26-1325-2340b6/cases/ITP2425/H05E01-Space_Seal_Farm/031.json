      "description": "The problem statement specifies that the getter and setter methods for the 'name' attribute in the Animal class should have protected visibility to ensure proper encapsulation and subclass access, but the solution implements them as public, which could confuse students about the correct access level and lead them to implement it differently from the intended design.",
