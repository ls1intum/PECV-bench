      "description": "The problem statement specifies a method named calculateTotalPrice that takes a Meal parameter and returns an int, intended to be static. However, the solution repository implements a method named computeMealCost with the same parameters and return type, while the Main class in the solution attempts to call calculateTotalPrice, which does not exist. This discrepancy creates confusion for students who follow the problem statement, as the solution code does not match the described design, potentially leading to compilation errors and misunderstanding of the intended implementation.",
