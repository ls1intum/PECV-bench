      "description": "The problem statement specifies that the calculateTotalPrice method in the SealSaloon class must be static because it uses the shared stock attribute. However, in the solution repository, this method is implemented as a non-static (instance) method, which contradicts the specified design. This inconsistency could confuse students about the correct use of static methods for shared resources, potentially leading them to implement it incorrectly based on the solution example.",

      "description": "The problem statement refers to a meal concept as 'Cowboy Stew' with capitalized words, while the template and solution repositories use 'cowBoyStew' as the actual string value for the meal name in the Main class. This discrepancy in casing and formatting for the same conceptual entity (the meal name) could confuse students, making it harder to map the descriptive text to the code implementation, potentially leading to errors in how students handle string representations.",
