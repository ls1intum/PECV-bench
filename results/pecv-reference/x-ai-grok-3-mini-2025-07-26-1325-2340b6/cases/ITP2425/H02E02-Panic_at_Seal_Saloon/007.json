      "description": "The method for handling supply deliveries is described as 'acceptSupplyDelivery' in the problem statement and referenced in the template code, but implemented as 'receiveDelivery' in the solution code. This inconsistency in method naming for the same conceptual entity could confuse students, making it difficult to map the required implementation from the problem statement to the final solution, potentially leading to incorrect implementations.",
