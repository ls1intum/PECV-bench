      "description": "The method acceptSupplyDelivery in the SealSaloon class is described in the problem statement as having four parameters (String, String, int, int), likely intended for supplier name, ingredient name, price, and quantity. However, in the solution repository, it is implemented with only three parameters (String, int, int), omitting the first String parameter. This discrepancy could confuse students who follow the problem statement, leading them to implement a version that doesn't match the provided solution structure, potentially causing errors when testing against expected outputs.",

If the parameter is not needed, revise the problem statement to align with the solution for consistency."
