      "description": "The method getNumberOfStudentsPerTutor is specified in the problem statement's UML diagram to return a double, allowing for precise division results (e.g., for fractional student-to-tutor ratios). However, in the solution repository, it is implemented to return an int, which could lead to integer division and loss of precision, potentially confusing students about the expected output type and causing their implementations to fail tests that expect a double.",
