      "description": "The problem statement specifies that the 'totalOrders' attribute in the SealSaloon class should be of type int, but in the solution repository, it is declared as a long. This discrepancy could confuse students who follow the problem statement's specification, leading them to implement it as an int, only to find the solution uses a different type, potentially causing inconsistencies in their code.",
