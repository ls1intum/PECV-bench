      "description": "The UML diagram in the problem statement specifies that the StockIngredient constructor should have three parameters (String, int, int), but the template repository implements it with four parameters (String, int, int, boolean). This discrepancy could confuse students, as they might try to use the constructor as described in the diagram, only to find it incompatible with the provided template code, potentially blocking their implementation progress.",
