      "description": "The method acceptSupplyDelivery is described in the problem statement's UML diagram as having four parameters (String, String, int, int), indicating it should take supplier name, ingredient name, price, and quantity. However, in the solution repository, it is implemented with only three parameters (String, int, int), which omits the supplier name. This discrepancy could confuse students who implement the method based on the problem description, only to find the solution differs, potentially leading to implementation errors or misunderstandings about the required design.",
